Ltd., IBC Ltd., Mil-Spec Industries Corp., Milwhite Inc., Newpark Resources Inc., Sachtleben Minerals GmbH and Co. KG, Sojitz Corp. The Barite mining market is experiencing significant growth due to increased demand for this mineral in various industries. Barite, a barium sulfate mineral, is widely used as a weighting agent in oil drilling, especially in the exploration of tight oil and shale formations. In the plastics industry, barite is used as an industrial filler to enhance the properties of plastic products, reducing their carbon footprint. Petroleum-based industries also utilize barite in radiation-proof structures for shielding against gamma rays and X-rays. The automotive industry uses barite as soundproofing material in brake linings and cable cars. In the fine chemical market, the powder segment dominates with applications in paint industry, adhesive industry, rubber industry, and white paint applications. Barite is also used in drilling mud, shielding panels for X-ray machines, and radiation shielding applications in submarines and ballast tanks. USP barite is used in the pharmaceutical industry for producing iodine used in CT scans and diagnostic tests. The paint industry, coatings industry, and cement industry also use barite as a filler agent. Barite is often mined from sedimentary rock formations, alongside minerals like calcite, silica sand, lead, zinc, silver, and iron ore. With the rising energy demand and oil prices, the oil & gas industry continues to be a major consumer of barite. However, with the emergence of barite substitutes like nano-silica grains and celestite, the market dynamics are changing.  The Middle East, home to significant oil and gas producers like Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, and Iraq, played a crucial role in the expansion of the barite market in 2021.

With rising food demand and focus on sustainable farming, there's a greater need for nutrients like potassium to improve soil fertility and crop yields. Precision agriculture and horticulture sectors, including greenhouse farming, also rely heavily on potassium chloride, muriate of potash, sulfate of potash (SOP), and potassium nitrate for high-value crops like vegetables and flowers. Potash-based fertilizers, such as potassium sulfate and potassium nitrates, are essential for crop productivity and food security. Potassium chlorides, sulfates, and nitrates are available in various forms, including solid and liquid fertilizers, for application through foliar, fertigation, broadcasting, and other methods. Organic farming and sustainable energy generation are also driving the market for chlorine-free fertilizers and those free of heavy metals and nitrogen. Fertilizer regulations continue to evolve, focusing on sustainable agricultural practices and food production. Agricultural investments in the potash market are expected to remain strong, with applications in cattle feed and cereals and grains, pulses and oilseeds, and fruits and vegetables.  In 2023, the global potash production was estimated at 39 million metric tons. By 2026, production capacity is projected to increase to 67.6 million metric tons due to new projects and expansions in countries like Laos and Russia. This growth is driven by the rising demand for potash, a vital nutrient for plant growth and essential component in fertilizers. Belaruskali, a significant potash manufacturer, plans to boost its production capacity to 15.9 million tons by 2025. This expansion is part of a broa"

Nutritional value is a key consideration, with many brands offering healthier options made from natural ingredients, such as corn dough, vegetables, and lean meats. Authentic flavors are ensured through the use of traditional chilies, seasoned fillings, and traditional wrapping materials like corn husks and banana leaves. Distribution channels include foodservice sectors and retail outlets. Packaging materials are chosen for their ability to maintain freshness and preserve the tamales' steamed texture. Gourmet options and ready-to-eat tamales cater to consumers seeking convenient, high-quality Mexican cuisine. Product formulations vary, with meat, cheese, and vegetable-based options available. Seafood-based tamales are also gaining popularity. The market continues to advance with innovations in product formulations and packaging materials, offering consumers a wider range of choices and convenience.  Online ordering systems offer several advantages for takeaway restaurants compared to traditional telephone orders. First, they eliminate communication errors that can occur during phone conversations. During peak hours, phone lines can become engaged, resulting in lost orders. Online platforms prevent this issue by allowing consumers to place orders at their convenience.

The tobacco segment saw a revenue of KRW 3.906 trillion and operating profit of KRW 1.082 trillion, a respective YoY growth of 8.1% and 10.7%. The continued growth of global sales volume and effective pricing strategies combined led to such results.

Furthermore, the board resolved to set the 2024 year-end dividend at KRW 4,200 per share, while setting the record date as February 28th. The annual dividend per share including the interim dividend of KRW 1,200 previously paid is KRW 5,400, up KRW 200 from the previous year. In 2024, KT&G moved the record date from the end of the year to date determined by the board. This decision was made to allow investors to acquire shares after confirming the dividend.

Market Driver The global Cookies Market is witnessing significant trends with bakers focusing on functional ingredients, low-fat and sugar-free options to cater to health-conscious consumers. Urbanization and increasing disposable income have boosted consumer spending power, driving demand for cookies. Home bakers and small businesses are capitalizing on this trend with hand-made, natural flavor cookies. Transparency of ingredients is crucial as consumers seek gluten-free, lactose-free, and celiac-friendly options due to chronic diseases like glutamic disorders and celiac disease. High input costs and supply chain disruptions challenge bakers, but product innovations, such as low-sugar, organic, and vegan cookies, continue to attract consumers. Marketing methods like brand creation, gifting options, and e-commerce have expanded the cookies market, reaching new demographics and emerging regions. Flavors like chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, snickerdoodles, and caramel-flavored minis remain popular. Regulations and global economic conditions impact the market, but brand loyalty and consumer perception remain key factors. Major players like Dunkin, Oreo, and retail stores dominate the market, with online retail and foodservice also gaining traction. Cookies continue to be a convenient snack option, adapting to changing consumer tastes and lifestyles.  The cookie market is witnessing a significant shift towards clean labeling due to increasing consumer awareness regarding food transparency. Countries like the US, the UK, and Germany have implemented strict regulations to ensure clear product formulation and labeling. This trend simplifies the cookie production process by using a minimal number of recognizable and health-perceived ingredients. Manufacturers prioritize using easily understandable and pronounceable components to cater to health-conscious consumers. By adhering t"

FY and Q4 2024 Results For the full year period, adjusted net income increased by an impressive 13% year-on-year to $5 billion. The company's strong performance was underpinned by robust demand for domestic gas which supported volume growth and improved pricing. Total sales volumes in FY 2024 increased by 2% to 3,616 million MMBTU. This increase in volume was enabled by a 13% increase in the ADNOC LNG (ALNG) joint venture contribution. Adjusted revenues increased by 7% YoY in FY 2024 to $24.43 billion driven by a 2% increase in sales volume and improved pricing. The company's strong top line performance for 2024 translated into a strong EBITDA growth of 14% to $8.65 billion with a high, stable margin of 35%. Free cash flow for the period reached an impressive $4.58 billion, reflecting the company's strong cash conversion capabilities.

ADNOC Gas delivered adjusted revenues of $6.06 billion, EBITDA of $2.28 billion and net income of $1.381 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.

These digital assets, represented by unique codes on a blockchain, bring scarcity and ownership to digital artworks, collectibles, and even virtual real estate. The gaming industry and media & entertainment sector have embraced NFTs, with Ethereum network leading the charge. NFTs allow for the tokenization of games, trading cards, and virtual items, creating new revenue streams for creators and investors.

Fraud and regulatory uncertainty remain concerns. The White House has acknowledged the potential of NFTs, but a clear legal framework is needed. Taxation and logistics are also important considerations. Despite these challenges, the future of NFTs is bright. They represent a new frontier in decentralized finance, enabling the tokenization of physical assets like art, houses, and vehicles.

Inc., and Thrive Life LLC Market Driver Emergency food market trends include food preservation techniques such as freeze-drying for longer shelf life in disaster relief efforts and camping. Freeze-dried food products like Peanut Butter, Dried Fruits, and Canned Juice are popular. Shelf life is crucial for individuals during power outages and transportation disruptions. Climate-related disasters like hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and droughts impact food supply chains, leading to food shortages. Brick-and-mortar retail outlets, grocery stores, specialty stores, and disaster supply centers sell emergency food supplies. Online sales of Ready-to-Eat meals, Cereals, and Infant Food are increasing. The defense sector uses non-perishable milk and infant food products in contracts. Packaging and preservation techniques ensure food security for individuals and civil and military emergency stockpiles. Dietary preferences like gluten-free, vegan, and allergen-free are catered to in the market. Offline and online sales of non-freeze-dried and freeze-dried food products continue to grow.  The demand for organic freeze-dried foods is on the rise due to increasing health consciousness among consumers. This trend is particularly noticeable in the UK and US markets, where the vegan population is significantly growing. Consumers with conditions like lactose intolerance and celiac disease are shifting towards vegan and gluten-free options. Organic freeze-dried foods offer a higher nutritional profile due to their simple processing method, which involves freeze-drying whole foods like acai, chia, cacao, moringa, flax, and turmeric. To be certified organic, vendors must adhere to strict organic conditions and standards during production. This includes sourcing raw products, nutrition extraction procedures, crop management, processing temperature, transportation, and packaging materials. The growing demand for meat alternatives and the health benefits of organic freeze-dried foods make this market an attrac"
Korea Zinc Secures Critical Metals Supply Chain Amid Global Export Controls,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/korea-zinc-secures-critical-metals-supply-chain-amid-global-export-controls-302369753.html,2025-02-06 11:40:00,"SEOUL, South Korea , Feb. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As U.S.-China trade tensions escalate into export controls on rare metals, Korea Zinc's (KRX:010130) role in maintaining supply chain stability for critical minerals has gained further strategic importance. On February 4, China announced that it would be immediately implementing export controls on five key metals, namely tungsten, molybdenum, indium, bismuth, and tellurium, used for defense, clean energy and in several other industries, just minutes after President Donald Trump's additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods came into effect. The rising tensions have highlighted the importance of establishing a more resilient supply chain for critical metals. Korea Zinc, as South Korea's sole producer of Indium, Bismuth, and Tellurium, which make up three of the five metals subject to the export controls, has found itself in a unique position to address these concerns. Korea Zinc annually produces 150 tons of Indium, which makes up about 11% of the total global demand of 1,400 tons. Indium is highly sought after as it is used in a wide variety of alloys such as Indium tin oxide (ITO) for monitors and touchscreens, and other uses such as solar panels and LEDs. The smelter also annually produces 900-1,000 tons Bismuth, and 100-200 tons of Tellurium. In addition to these three metals, Korea Zinc annually produces an approximate total of 120 million tons of 10+ non-ferrous metals. The company produces these rare metals by extracting them with its leading proprietary technology during the smelting process of zinc and lead concentrates sourced from global mines. A Korea Zinc spokesperson stated, ""Given that some critical metals are produced by only a few countries, Korea Zinc's role in establishing a more stable supply chain is crucial. We continue to provide stable supply to domestic industries despite global shortages. Korea Zinc has anticipated the importance of global rare metals and has consistently increased production."" The company demonstrated this capability during China's antimony export controls in September 2024, maintaining stable domestic supply through its advanced production capabilities. Korea Zinc is currently looking to replicate this initiative by increasing production for Indium, Bismuth, and Tellurium in South Korea first, as current Chinese import dependency rates for them in South Korea are notably high. South Korea currently relies on 92.8%, 95.8%, and 61.2% of Indium, Bismuth, and Tellurium respectively. About Korea Zinc: Korea Zinc is a global leader in non-ferrous metal smelting and refining, processing materials from worldwide mines to produce essential metals and rare elements crucial for high-tech industries. The company's unique technological advantage in recovering valuable metals from production byproducts has established it as a world leader in the field. SOURCE Korea Zinc"

(""Grocery Outlet"") (NASDAQ: GO)  on behalf of those who purchased or acquired Grocery Outlet securities between November 7, 2023, and May 7, 2024, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The lead plaintiff deadline is March 31, 2025.

During the call, Defendants disclosed an ongoing systems transition (the ""Systems Transition"") that began in August and would be completed by the end of the year.  Defendants also provided investors with material information concerning Grocery Outlet's expected profit for fiscal year 2024.  Throughout the Class Period, Defendants continued to create the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to the completion of Grocery Outlet's Systems Transition and any potential negative impact resulting therefrom, while also minimizing the risks associated with potential and perceived setbacks to the company's finances as a result of implementation errors and other issues surrounding the Systems Transition.  Then, on May 7, 2024, Defendants shocked the market when they released the company's first quarter fiscal year 2024 results, which surprisingly announced both a significantly larger-than-expected impact from Systems Transition issues and significantly below-market guidance for the second quarter.   As a result of the foregoing, the price of Grocery Outlet's common stock declined dramatically, from a closing price of $25.90 per share on May 7, 2024, to $20.88 per share on May 8, 2024, a decline of about 19.38% in the span of just a single day. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS:Grocery Outlet investors may, no later than March 31, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation.  The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP encourages Grocery Outlet investors who have suffered significant losses to contact the firm directly to acquire more information.

Securities Fraud Lawsuit",https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mu-investors-have-opportunity-to-lead-micron-technology-inc-securities-fraud-lawsuit-302369351.html,2025-02-06 06:35:00,"NEW YORK, Feb. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Why: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of common stock of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) between September 28, 2023 and December 18, 2024, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important March 10, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. So what: If you purchased Micron common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. What to do next: To join the Micron class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=33605 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 10, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially Micron's NAND products, non-volatile, re-writeable semiconductor storage devices that provide high-capacity, low-cost storage with a variety of performance characteristics, had significantly deteriorated; (2) accordingly, defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (3) as a result, Micron's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Micron class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=33605 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that GSK PLC (GSK) Misled Investors Regarding its Recall of Zantac According to the complaint, in September and October 2019, GSK suspended its distribution of Zantac and initiated a voluntary recall. In April 2020, the FDA requested that manufacturers cease selling Zantac and any generic alternatives.  The complaint alleges that during the class period, defendants misrepresented the reasons it removed Zantac from the market and asserted that ""there is no evidence of a causal association between ranitidine therapy and the development of cancer in patients,"" even though GSK had concealed unpublished data showing a connection and implicating the Company's liability to Zantac users.     Plaintiff alleges that tens of thousands of cancer-stricken patients filed personal injury and product liability lawsuits against GSK in the years that followed the recall. According to the complaint, on August 10, 2022, a Deutsche Bank report alerted the market that it seemed ""very possible"" that GSK and other Zantac distributors ""will incur the risk of some degree of shared liability, with the only real questions being what the magnitude of liability may be."" The Deutsche Bank report forecasted that the total liability in relation to the litigation could be between $5 billion and $10 billion. On this news, the price of GSK ADRs declined by $4.30 per ADR, or more than 10%. The complaint further alleges that the price of GSK ADRs declined further on August 15, 2022, when GSK admitted that it could, in fact, provide guidance and that its liability exposure was between $1 billion and $10 billion. The eventual settlement of $2.2 billion fell squarely in that range. These disclosures caused GSK ADRs to decline an additional $1.08 per ADR, or 3%. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against GSK PLC. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must file papers with the court by April 7, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.  You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery.

Aside from objections over celebrity likenesses being used without permission, accuracy issues create unique challenges for entertainment. When they do give permission, many stars express doubts about the reliability of AI-generated voice and image content and how misuse could damage their reputation. This highlights a critical challenge: the risk of AI hallucination, where systems create false or misleading content. In high-stakes areas like celebrity licensing, such inaccuracies can lead to PR disasters. Traditional approaches to mitigating these risks often rely on static, pre-recorded content, which limits the dynamic, real-time engagement fans desire and fails to deliver true commercial value for businesses. Enter Vyin AI's Vyin Brain—a groundbreaking generative AI chatbot engineered for accuracy and reliability. By employing a unique multi-hub brain architecture, it separates knowledge processing from language generation, dramatically reducing hallucinations. Coupled with D-RAG Technology, Vyin Brain achieves an extraordinary 93% precision rate, outpacing the industry standard of 53%. This ensures contextually sound, dependable interactions, redefining possibilities in celebrity IP licensing. For celebrity-focused use cases, Vyin Brain provides a tailored approach to risk management by simulating and preempting potentially risky scenarios. For example, for information about  celebrities, where topics like personal relationships can be controversial, the system is specifically designed to deliver cautious, tactful responses within predefined boundaries. This not only ensures reputational safety for celebrities but also maintains meaningful fan engagement. When integrated with Vyin AI's real-time video generation capabilities, the result is an unrivaled platform for seamless, secure interactions between celebrities and their fans. By harmonizing innovation with responsibility, Vyin AI is setting a new gold standard for AI applications in the entertainment industry.

Securities Fraud Lawsuit",https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regn-investors-have-opportunity-to-lead-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-securities-fraud-lawsuit-302369323.html,2025-02-06 05:12:00,"NEW YORK, Feb. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) between November 2, 2023 and October 30, 2024, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important March 10, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. So what: If you purchased Regeneron securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. What to do next: To join the Regeneron class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=33630 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 10, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Regeneron paid credit card fees to distributors on the condition that distributors did not charge Eylea customers, one of Regeneron's primary products, more to use a credit card; (2) these payments subsidized the prices that customers paid when using credit cards to purchase Eylea; (3) as a result, Regeneron offered a price concession that lowered Eylea's selling price; (4) because retina practices were sensitive to higher prices when using credit cards to purchase anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (""anti-VEGF"") medications, Regeneron's price concessions provided a competitive advantage; (5) as a result of the foregoing, Regeneron misleadingly boosted reported Eylea sales; (6) by failing to report its payment of credit card fees as price concessions, Regeneron overstated the Average Sales Price (""ASP"") reported to federal agencies, thereby violating the False Claims Act; and (7) as a result of the foregoing, defendants' positive statements about Regeneron's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Tennessee SHIELD Pilot Program: A Revolutionary Step Toward Public Safety and Fiscal Responsibility,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tennessee-shield-pilot-program-a-revolutionary-step-toward-public-safety-and-fiscal-responsibility-302368921.html,2025-02-06 04:02:00,"NASHVILLE, Tenn., Feb. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- SHIELD is proud to announce the opportunity for the state of Tennessee to pilot a groundbreaking initiative designed to enhance public safety while maximizing state resources. This comprehensive program integrates advanced safety measures, optimized emergency response protocols, and cost-saving innovations to create a more secure and efficient system for first responders and the communities they serve. Had this program been in place before Hurricane Helene, the state of Tennessee could have saved $55 million in post disaster response (more on that in the Hurricane Helene Report attached in this release). Key Highlights of the Tennessee SHIELD Pilot Program:  Savings and Economic Impact According to the Helene Report, SHIELD could have saved the state up to 55 million dollars had it been in place before the hurricane. By implementing proactive safety measures and streamlining emergency response, significant financial losses could have been mitigated. The report highlights that faster deployment of resources and improved coordination could have reduced damage and recovery costs. This underscores the program's potential for long-term fiscal benefits and disaster preparedness. SHIELD is expected to deliver substantial cost reductions by improving efficiency in public safety operations. Key financial benefits include:  A Safer Future for Tennessee The Tennessee SHIELD Pilot Program reinforces the state's commitment to protecting students, first responders, and communities while ensuring taxpayer dollars are used effectively. By modernizing safety measures, integrating technology, and prioritizing rapid emergency response, Tennessee is setting a new national standard for public safety and fiscal responsibility.  About SHIELD The SHIELD Pilot Program is proposed as a state-funded initiative focused on improving public safety, school security, roadway safety, and first responder efficiency while ensuring cost-effective operations. Through innovative technology, strategic partnerships, and data-driven solutions, the program is designed to serve as a model for nationwide safety improvements.  Media Contact:  William Robertson/ Owner Dr. Bill Robertson/ Owner 615.708.3187 [email protected] Click or copy paste the links below for real life examples where SHIELD could have changed the story: *warning* These videos may be disturbing to some viewers as they highlight the very real dangers our communities face every day.  https://youtu.be/-1IRqvByYpw https://youtu.be/_hmCVZmKErw  For more information on the Tennessee SHIELD Pilot Program, visit www.1-shield.com or email William Robertson or Bill Robertson at [email protected]. The Helene Economic Policy Brief: Benefits of SHIELD's digital siren and bullhorn during Hurricane Helene in Tennessee Hurricane Helene was a devastating hurricane that killed over 230 people across six states. The property damage estimates by Corelogic, a property data and analytics company, ranged between $30.5 to $47.4 billion.  This estimate does not include damages to public buildings and infrastructure such as roads and bridges.  As more severe disasters become commonplace, private and public stakeholders must adapt new tools and approaches to reduce these costs and improve health and safety outcomes.  One such tool is a digital siren and bullhorn that can warn citizens about natural disasters, provide information about evacuation routes, and assist first responders. This brief applies the methodology of Brent (2022) to calculate the benefits of a digital siren and bullhorn in Tennessee during Hurricane Helene.  The approach assumes that the benefits due to reduced mortality are similar during a natural disaster.  Previous estimates showed a 7% decrease in traffic mortalities due to a digital siren and bullhorn.  Applying this probabilistically to the 17 deaths in Tennessee during Hurricane Helene generates a $15 million benefit due to reduced mortality.

Global Biologics Drug Substance Manufacturing Market to Exhibit Growth at a CAGR of ~11% by 2032 | DelveInsight,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-biologics-drug-substance-manufacturing-market-to-exhibit-growth-at-a-cagr-of-11-by-2032--delveinsight-302368365.html,2025-02-06 04:01:00,"The biologics drug substance manufacturing market is witnessing substantial expansion, largely due to the growing prevalence of chronic diseases, which is driving the need for biologics development and production. This upward trend is further supported by advancements in manufacturing technology, increased research and development efforts, and a wave of new product launches by major industry players. LAS VEGAS, Feb. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- DelveInsight's Biologics Drug Substance Manufacturing Market Insights report provides the current and forecast market analysis, individual leading biologics drug substance manufacturing companies' market shares, challenges, biologics drug substance manufacturing market drivers, barriers, trends, and key market biologics drug substance manufacturing companies in the market. Key Takeaways from the Biologics Drug Substance Manufacturing Market Report To read more about the latest highlights related to the biologics drug substance manufacturing market, get a snapshot of the key highlights entailed in the Global Biologics Drug Substance Manufacturing Market Report Biologics Drug Substance Manufacturing Overview Biologics drug substance manufacturing is a highly complex and tightly regulated process that involves the production of therapeutic proteins, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and other biologics derived from living cells. Unlike small molecule drugs, biologics are large, structurally intricate molecules produced using cell culture systems such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, bacterial or yeast expression systems. The process typically involves upstream processing, where cell lines are cultivated in bioreactors under controlled conditions to maximize yield, followed by downstream processing, which includes purification steps such as chromatography and ultrafiltration to ensure high purity and efficacy. Stringent quality control and adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) are crucial at every stage to ensure consistency, safety, and efficacy of the final drug substance.   Scaling up biologics manufacturing from lab-scale to commercial production presents significant challenges, including maintaining cell viability, optimizing yields, and ensuring batch-to-batch consistency. Advances in single-use bioreactors, process intensification, and automation have helped streamline manufacturing while improving flexibility and cost efficiency. Regulatory agencies such as the FDA and EMA impose strict guidelines on manufacturing practices, requiring extensive characterization, validation, and risk mitigation strategies to minimize variability and contamination risks. As biologics continue to dominate the pharmaceutical market, innovations in continuous manufacturing, cell-free synthesis, and AI-driven process optimization are shaping the future of biologics drug substance manufacturing, making it more scalable, efficient, and accessible for global patient needs. Biologics Drug Substance Manufacturing Market Insights In 2024, North America held the largest share of the biologics drug substance manufacturing market among all regions. This growth is primarily fueled by a rising patient population affected by chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes. Additionally, the increasing geriatric population, which is more prone to such conditions, further accelerates market expansion. Key contributors to this trend include heightened research and development efforts by leading companies and the growing adoption of biologic drugs.   To strengthen their market presence, major industry players are actively establishing biologics manufacturing facilities in the region. For example, in July 2024, BeiGene Ltd. inaugurated its flagship U.S. facility in Hopewell, New Jersey, within the Princeton West Innovation Campus. This advanced site integrates state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing with a clinical research and development center, reinforcing BeiGene's position as a leader in oncology innovation. Span"

The campaign, inspired by the late Mats Steen and the award-winning Netflix documentary about his life, The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, raised an impressive $2 million. It is the most significant contribution that CureDuchenne has received from a corporation to date and will support groundbreaking research and vital care programs for individuals affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare neuromuscular disease. Mats, a Norwegian World of Warcraft player known in game as Ibelin, was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy as a young boy and sadly, lost his battle with the disease at the young age of 25. In the wake of his death, his family discovered what they thought was a life lived in total isolation was in fact filled with joy, laughter, friendship and love through Mats' adventures in World of Warcraft. The game opened a world of community and connection his family never knew existed and gave him a rich set of friends and experiences that would not have been possible outside of the game environment. Mats was a supportive friend and trusted advisor who made a tremendous impact on the lives of all he encountered in the game. World of Warcraft players had the opportunity to build on Mats' legacy and adopt a limited-edition pet fox, named Reven (""fox"" in Norwegian), in World of Warcraft to accompany them on their adventures while supporting CureDuchenne. All proceeds* from The Reven Pack support CureDuchenne's mission to accelerate research toward a cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and improve care for individuals worldwide living with the disease.  The global gaming community rallied behind the initiative, making this one of the most successful fundraising collaborations in World of Warcraft's history. The tribute to Mats Steen within the game not only honored his legacy but also sparked worldwide awareness of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, reinforcing the power of community, connection, and storytelling in making a real-world impact. ""This campaign has been truly extraordinary—not only in the critical funds raised for research, but in the awareness it has generated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"" said Debra Miller, Founder and CEO of CureDuchenne. ""Through this partnership, thousands of families affected by Duchenne have felt seen, heard, and supported in a way that is truly remarkable. The World of Warcraft community has shown that gaming can be a powerful force for good, and we are deeply grateful to Blizzard, the Steen family, and to every player who joined us in honoring Mats Steen and making a real difference in the lives of those affected by Duchenne."" ""Every day, I'm greatly humbled by the kindness of the World of Warcraft community,"" said World of Warcraft executive producer, Holly Longdale. ""Your generosity in supporting this year's charity pet program for CureDuchenne will help enable their incredible work and honors the deeply impactful life lived by Mats Steen--the inspiration for this year's program. On behalf of the WoW team, thank you to our players, the Steen family, and the CureDuchenne team for bringing awareness to and supporting this cause. We invite all to continue showing their support to CureDuchenne where they can, and to continue to honor the legacy of Ibelin both in-game and out with compassion and joy."" *Blizzard Entertainment donated 100% of the purchase price of ""The Reven Pack"" digital bundle to CureDuchenne, less any chargebacks, refunds, transaction fees, and Value Added Taxes (VAT), or other similar taxes paid"

While we made progress during that time, we also faced our share of challenges. Our financial performance and stock price growth didn't fully reflect our potential or long-term trends. In 2023, we took meaningful steps to move beyond this transitional phase and set the stage for the next chapter of our success.  Those efforts have shown positive results.  Today we announced operating earnings in excess of $3.7 billion for 2024, and our stock price has increased over 30% since the beginning of 2023.  Nonetheless, we believe the value and potential of our combined group of businesses is not fully reflected in our current stock price.   We still have work to do, and if we continue to make progress there is substantial upside at Markel Group. In December 2024, JANA Partners publicly shared their perspectives on Markel Group and offered suggestions we might consider. We took this as an opportunity for broader self-reflection, in line with our commitment to the ""zealous pursuit of excellence.""

While opinions varied, we're committed to listening, learning, and considering all perspectives at both the board and company levels. This process strengthens us for the benefit of our customers, shareholders, and team members.

""We are deeply grateful to the Merus team that designed, researched and developed zenocutuzumab, the eNRGy trial investigators, and the dedicated study participants who helped advance this important research.""

These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).

Volume was up 17% versus the prior-year period on growth in both Crop Protection and Seed. Crop Protection volume increased 16% over the prior year driven primarily by Latin America on demand for new products, spinosyns, and biologicals.  Seed volume increased 19% versus prior year due to the expected increase in Safrinha corn planted area in Brazil. Price declined 4% versus prior year, reflecting expected lower Seed pricing in Brazil, as well as competitive price dynamics in Crop Protection, primarily in Latin America. GAAP income from continuing operations after income taxes was a loss of $50 million in fourth quarter of 2024 compared to a loss of $231 million in fourth quarter of 2023. Operating EBITDA1 for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $525 million, up 36% compared to prior year, translating into approximately 280 basis points of Operating EBITDA1 margin improvement. 4Q    4Q    % % ($ in millions, except where noted) 2024 2023 Change Organic1 Change Net Sales $3,978 $3,707 7 % 13 % North America $1,563 $1,497 4 % 5 % EMEA $448 $371 21 % 22 % Latin America $1,622 $1,522 7 % 20 % Asia Pacific $345 $317 9 % 10 % FY    FY    % % ($ in millions, except where noted) 2024 2023 Change Organic1 Change Net Sales $16,908 $17,226 (2) % 1 % North America $8,660 $8,590 1 % 1 % EMEA $3,124 $3,367 (7) % (2) % Latin America $3,776 $3,906 (3) % 4 % Asia Pacific $1,348 $1,363 (1) % 1 % Seed SummarySeed net sales were $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, up from $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. The sales increase reflects a 19% increase in volume, a 3% decline in price and an 8% unfavorable impact from currency.

AZN Investors Have Opportunity to Lead AstraZeneca PLC Securities Fraud Lawsuit Filed by The Rosen Law Firm,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/azn-investors-have-opportunity-to-lead-astrazeneca-plc-securities-fraud-lawsuit-filed-by-the-rosen-law-firm-302369272.html,2025-02-06 02:59:00,"NEW YORK, Feb. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --  Why: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ: AZN) between February 23, 2022 and December 17, 2024, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the February 21, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm. So what: If you purchased AstraZeneca securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. What to do next: To join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AstraZeneca engaged in insurance fraud in China; (2) as a result, AstraZeneca faced heightened legal exposure in China, which eventually resulted in the AstraZeneca China President being detained by Chinese law enforcement authorities; (3) as a result, AstraZeneca understated its legal risks; (4) the foregoing, once revealed, could materially harm AstraZeneca's business activities in China; and (5) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the AstraZeneca class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=1331 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Hillenbrand Reports Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Results and Announces Sale of Majority Stake in Milacron Injection Molding and Extrusion Business,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hillenbrand-reports-fiscal-first-quarter-2025-results-and-announces-sale-of-majority-stake-in-milacron-injection-molding-and-extrusion-business-302369402.html,2025-02-06 02:47:00,"Updates Full Year Guidance to Reflect Transaction; Maintains Outlook for Remaining Businesses BATESVILLE, Ind., Feb. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Hillenbrand, Inc. (NYSE: HI), a leading global provider of highly-engineered processing equipment and solutions, reported results for the fiscal first quarter, which ended December 31, 2024, and announced the majority sale of its Milacron injection molding and extrusion business, within the Molding Technology Solutions (MTS) segment, to an affiliate of Bain Capital. Reported results for the fiscal first quarter include Milacron in both the consolidated and MTS results. Hillenbrand's annual guidance has been updated to reflect the impact of the transaction. ""We delivered first quarter results in line with our expectations, with continued momentum in executing cross-selling and cost synergies within our food, health, and nutrition portfolio. Our teams remained focused on advancing our integration initiatives and managing discretionary costs, as total order volumes remained soft, which we had anticipated. Our customer quote pipelines remain healthy, reinforcing our confidence in our long-term strategy. Despite the challenging macro environment, we believe our strong competitive positioning will enable us to deliver significant value to our customers as end markets recover, driving profitable growth across our business."" ""The agreement to divest a majority stake in the Milacron business reflects the continuation of Hillenbrand's transformation as we've significantly reshaped our portfolio toward less cyclical, higher-growth opportunities. Over the last few years, we have exited our secularly declining death care segment and pursued several strategic acquisitions, building scale in the attractive food, health, and nutrition end markets, which now comprise just under 30% of our total revenue mix on a pro forma basis. We believe this transaction not only delivers value for Hillenbrand and our shareholders, but also Milacron and its customers, as they have a strong partner in Bain Capital to help drive their next phase of growth,"" said Kim Ryan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hillenbrand.

MAA REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2024 RESULTS,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maa-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results-302369392.html,2025-02-06 02:45:00,"GERMANTOWN, Tenn., Feb. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc., or MAA (NYSE: MAA), today announced operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2024. Fourth Quarter 2024 Operating Results Three months ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Earnings per common share - diluted $ 1.42 $ 1.37 $ 4.49 $ 4.71 Funds from operations (FFO) per Share - diluted $ 2.21 $ 2.53 $ 8.77 $ 9.39 Core FFO per Share - diluted $ 2.23 $ 2.32 $ 8.88 $ 9.17 A reconciliation of Net income available for MAA common shareholders to FFO and Core FFO, and discussion of the components of FFO and Core FFO, can be found later in this release. FFO per Share – diluted and Core FFO per Share – diluted include diluted common shares and units.  Eric Bolton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""We are encouraged by the performance trends captured in the fourth quarter and the early signs of improvement in pricing trends as the record level of new supply deliveries has now peaked.  Calendar year 2025 will be a transition year for revenue performance as the decline in new supply deliveries will provide for increasingly tighter market conditions and resulting rent growth.  As we reprice leases over the busy spring and summer leasing season, the compounding impact in overall revenue performance will become increasingly evident late this year and into 2026. Same Store Portfolio blended lease pricing, on a sequential basis from the seasonally strong third quarter to the typically slower fourth quarter, improved 140 basis points as compared to the same sequential trend of the prior year.  Capturing this improvement in year-over-year pricing trends, despite the record level of new supply deliveries over the past year, we believe speaks to the continued strong demand for apartment housing across our portfolio.  Further, it puts MAA in a solid position to capture recovery in rental pricing as we head into 2025 with the delivery of new supply poised to meaningfully decline.""

ActiveState's Vulnerability Management as a Service is a market-first offering, uniquely combining Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) and Intelligent Remediation capabilities with expert guidance. This solution enables DevSecOps teams to not only identify vulnerabilities in open source packages, but also to automatically prioritize, remediate, and deploy fixes into production without breaking changes, ensuring that applications are truly secured. 
""DevOps teams tell us they spend tens of thousands of hours each year sifting through alerts, researching whether vulnerabilities are reachable and if fixing them might break current functionality, prioritizing what to fix first, and then making sure the work gets done,"" said Scott Robertson, CTO, ActiveState. ""ActiveState's Vulnerability Management as a Service zeroes in on these challenges, and acts as a DevOps co-pilot that removes the tedium and time-consuming nature of the tasks while giving them the control they desire to get the job done quickly and effectively.""

""ActiveState's Vulnerability Management as a Service zeroes in on these challenges, and acts as a DevOps co-pilot that removes the tedium and time-consuming nature of the tasks while giving them the control they desire to get the job done quickly and effectively.""   ActiveState's ASPM combines game-changing intelligent remediation capabilities with industry best service & support. Current approaches to vulnerability management are not keeping pace with efforts to exploit them. Ninety percent (90%) of the code running in production is of open source origin, which presents a significant risk: Open source vulnerabilities rose by 130% in 2024 and critical vulnerabilities are present in 74% of code bases. Fewer than 40% of companies report that they actually remediate vulnerabilities, and when they do, it takes an average of 270 days to deploy a fix. The time to exploit by bad actors, by contrast, is less than 24 hours. 
Existing tools overwhelm DevSecOps teams with excessive vulnerability data, false positives, and a lack of prioritization, often leading to inaction and increased exposure to exploits. Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) tools like ActiveState help identify, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities throughout the entire software development lifecycle. However, ActiveState is the sole provider of Vulnerability Management as a Service in the ASPM market, setting itself apart with a unique combination of ASPM, Intelligent Remediation, and expert guidance that help companies maximize the value they receive.ActiveState changes the vulnerability management landscape for DevSecOps teams by providing a comprehensive view of vulnerability status across their application portfolio, enabling them to prioritize the vulnerabilities that matter, assess the risk of updates, and choose recommended remediation paths based on corporate policies and avoiding breaking changes. The platform facilitates the secure building of open source packages from source, allows better governance of open source software usage, and ultimately empowers teams to move from a reactive, time-consuming process to proactive,"

WASHINGTON, Feb. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR) proudly launched its first-ever Federal Policy Solutions to Advance Gender Equity agenda today. This bold blueprint presents actionable recommendations to improve women's lives and a clear roadmap for policymakers and advocates striving for meaningful, lasting change. Released as the Trump administration begins rolling out policies that directly attack gender equity, racial justice, and human rights, IWPR's agenda tackles the systemic inequities that threaten women's health and financial security. ""I'm sure many people are asking, 'Why release this agenda now?'"" said Dr. Jamila K. Taylor, president and CEO of IWPR. ""The simple answer is good policy is good policy. This isn't about waiting for the right political moment or hoping for the 'perfect' leadership. It's about rolling up our sleeves and fighting for what's right, no matter the political tides. The time for action is always now, and even as we fight against regressive policies, we also must continue to build momentum toward policies that will strengthen our nation—especially when so much is at stake for women and families."" As a leading research think tank for gender equity, IWPR is unwavering in its mission to drive systemic change. Through compelling, evidence-based research that examines the intersection of gender and racial justice, IWPR actively challenges threats to progress, debunks harmful misinformation, and raises public awareness of the urgent need for reform. The Institute's 14-issue agenda prioritizes four core areas that demand immediate attention: The agenda includes specific recommendations on paid family leave, closing the gender wage gap, safeguarding reproductive rights, and creating pathways to higher-paying jobs. It also emphasizes the need for intersectional policies that address the unique challenges faced by women of color, working mothers, and student parents. Through these solutions, IWPR aims to spark a productive dialogue on gender equity that transcends political divisions. Amidst an increasingly polarized political landscape, IWPR's Federal Policy Solutions to Advance Gender Equity agenda offers a hopeful way forward —one rooted in bipartisan collaboration and action. The agenda calls on lawmakers, advocates, and communities to unite around policies that are not only essential but also achievable. ""This agenda is not just a reaction to the present; it's a long-term tool that we will use over the next four years to evaluate progress and hold policymakers accountable,"" said Dr. Taylor. ""Though the road ahead is challenging, the possibility for change is still within our grasp.""

(""Boardwalktech"") (TSXV: BWLK) (OTCQB: BWLKF), the leading Intelligent Information Platform company, announced today that it continues expansion in one of its banking customers who is a top 5 US Bank. Boardwalktech reached an important milestone at the end of January 2025 in the delivery of its Velocity product, increasing annual recurring revenue and expanding professional services agreements with multiple partners through 2025 which will deliver over $300,000 of incremental revenue to Boardwalktech from this engagement, which represents a doubling to comparable levels last year for the Company. This joint professional services work is also critical to the projected contractual increase in annual recurring revenue when the bank renews its license in April. Banks continue to face mounting regulatory pressure to mitigate and improve the risks associated with end-user computing applications (EUCs). Many of these EUCs are developed and managed using Microsoft Excel, which has become an integral part of how banks manage and report on many areas of their business. Boardwalktech's innovative Velocity solution empowers banks and insurance companies to effortlessly achieve their regulatory and compliance objectives through the seamless migration and transformation of Excel-based EUCs to IT controlled and managed business applications, setting new industry standards.  Boardwalk Velocity rapidly delivers significant business process improvements, full compliance with regulatory standards and improved risk reduction allowing banks to understand, report and make more timely decisions improving overall results. All of this is done 15 times faster and more economically than our nearest competitor. This issue of EUC transformation, which banks have historically avoided due to its extensive scope, reliance on exhaustive manual solutions, highly intricate nature, and overall cost to mitigate can no longer be ignored by relying on conventional brute-force solutions. In light of the evolving regulatory environment and risk management implications, EUC transformation and improving the risks associated with EUCs has evolved into a top priority in most banks.   ""Our continued contract expansion within our Top 5 US bank client is a testament to the value that Boardwalktech's Velocity and our people can deliver to major financial institutions. Currently, through both Boardwalktech employees and our very important delivery partners, we have over 50 dedicated people working to deliver the Velocity solution across the bank,"" said Andrew T. Duncan, Chief Executive Officer of Boardwalktech. ""Yet, it isn't just the expansion within the current client that excites us.  These partners, and other potential partners are seeing the documented value-add of the Velocity solution, and directly applying that learning towards other new opportunities. Thus, we fully expect to see other banks adopt the Velocity solution as we continue to outpace any competition with regard to speed of delivery, improvement of the risk management and transformation of these EUCs.""

(NYSE: UAA, UA) announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2025, which ended on December 31, 2024. The company reports its financial performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). This press release includes references to ""currency neutral"" and ""adjusted"" amounts, which are non-GAAP financial measures detailed in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Information"" section below. ""We are pleased our quarterly results exceeded expectations,"" said Under Armour President and CEO Kevin Plank. ""As we sharpen our focus on strengthening the Under Armour brand, our updated product strategy and enhanced marketplace discipline combined with the shift to a category-led operating model are driving our transformation."" ""Additionally, we will enter a pivotal new chapter in our marketing strategy by launching a dynamic, multi-year initiative of storytelling that showcases our incredible products, talented athletes, and influential creators,"" Plank continued. ""This will greatly enhance our visibility and empower our authentic connection with athletes to elevate our brand like never before."" Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Review  Share Buyback Program Under Armour repurchased $25 million of its Class C common stock in the third quarter, retiring 2.8 million shares. By December 31, 2024, 8.7 million shares had been repurchased for $65 million as part of a three-year, $500 million program that the Board of Directors approved in May 2024. Fiscal 2025 Restructuring Plan  In May 2024, Under Armour announced a restructuring plan to improve the company's financial and operational efficiencies. After further evaluation, in September 2024, the company disclosed additional restructuring actions, mainly centered on the decision to close one of its distribution centers in Rialto, California. This decision increased the anticipated range of its restructuring plan to between $140 million and $160 million, with up to $75 million expected to be cash-related and as much as $85 million projected as non-cash charges. By the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2025, the company had recognized $42 million in restructuring and impairment charges and $15 million in other related transformational expenses under the plan. Of the total $57 million incurred thus far, $40 million is cash-related, and $17 million is non-cash-related.

Among the key applications are urban air mobility (UAM) or passenger air taxi, intercity transportation, cargo, and emergency such as air ambulance and disaster rescue. Advancements in vertiport infrastructure, urban air traffic management systems, and regulatory frameworks by authorities such as the FAA and EASA all support global adoption. Companies leading the charge in commercializing eVTOLs for real-world operations include Joby Aviation, Archer Aviation, Lilium, and Volocopter. Based on System, the aerostructure segment is estimated to account for the largest share in the eVTOL Aircraft market from 2024 to 2035. The aerostructure segment will dominate the eVTOL aircraft market due to its major role in determining the structural integrity, performance efficiency, and overall structure of the eVTOLs. Aerostructures are simply the aircraft fuselage, wings, rotor mounts, and landing gear, which are an essential feature of any eVTOL design. These parts are considered essential in providing the structural framework needed to support propulsion systems, batteries, and payloads while also enhancing aerodynamic efficiency and safety. The demand for carbon composites and advanced alloys in eVTOL's lightweight, high-strength materials market is driving aerostructure design innovations. Lightweight aerostructures represent the key in reducing overall aircraft weight, which maximizes the efficiency of its battery and gives it an extended range—a critical feature for the success of eVTOLs. Aerostructures become even more precise in their designs as eVTOL designs adopt features such as vectored thrust, lift-plus-cruise, and hybrid propulsion systems and are required to manage complex flight dynamics and meet safety requirements. Based on Application, the Air Taxi segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the eVTOL Aircraft market from 2024 to 2035. The eVTOL aircraft market is expected to be headed by the air taxi segment because it has the disruptive potential to serve as a revolutionary solution that can address urban congestion and reduce travel times while offerin"

Ltd, PHI Inc., REVA Inc., Acadian Ambulance Service Inc., and Air Ambulance Worldwide Market Driver Air ambulance market is witnessing significant growth due to the increasing prevalence of medical emergencies, particularly in remote locations. Aerial vehicles, such as helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, play a crucial role in transporting patients to medical facilities in a timely and efficient manner. Advanced medical devices like ventilators, heart monitors, and defibrillators are essential for providing critical care during air transport. Trained medical crew, including flight nurses and paramedics, ensure patients receive proper care en route. Air ambulance companies offer both profit-based and non-profit services, providing solutions for trauma patients, stroke victims, heart attack survivors, and those with chronic ailments such as diabetes and cancer. Modern communications technologies enable real-time coordination between ground ambulances, hospitals, and air ambulance crews, ensuring seamless patient care. Aviation operators employ pilots, mechanics, and medical direction to ensure safe and effective operations. Despite unexpected out-of-network bills, the demand for air ambulance services continues to rise due to their lifesaving capabilities. However, challenges such as bad weather, aircraft maintenance, and patient billing remain significant concerns. Helicopter transport and plane flights offer unique advantages, with helicopters providing quick access to accident scenes and fixed-wing aircraft offering longer-range capabilities. Ultimately, the air ambulance market will continue to evolve, driven by the need to save lives in emergencies.  The popularity of recreational activities, such as trekking, hiking, swimming, rafting, and paragliding,"

From the Tax Law Offices of David W. Klasing - What is a Tax Investigation or Prosecution Proffer Agreement?,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/from-the-tax-law-offices-of-david-w-klasing---what-is-a-tax-investigation-or-prosecution-proffer-agreement-302369018.html,2025-02-06 17:07:00,"IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A proffer agreement is sometimes made in criminal tax cases. It is an agreement, usually written, between a federal prosecutor and an individual who is under a criminal tax investigation. It is designed to give the person some legal protection from criminal tax prosecution in exchange for giving up information to the government. Basically, it is a sit down with federal prosecutors and any other attorneys or agents involved in the matter representing agencies involved for a question and answer session. 
That protection, though, is limited. A proffer session is serious business, indeed. The individual deciding to enter into a proffer agreement with a federal prosecutor over income tax issues should always seek experienced criminal tax defense counsel first. In law, we are careful to qualify our statements with ""sometimes,"" ""often,"" or ""it depends."" This is the exception: Individuals should always seek legal counsel prior to deciding to ""proffer"" with the government.
 That protection, though, is limited. A proffer session is serious business, indeed. The individual deciding to enter into a proffer agreement with a federal prosecutor over income tax issues should always seek experienced criminal tax defense counsel first. In law, we are careful to qualify our statements with ""sometimes,"" ""often,"" or ""it depends."" This is the exception: Individuals should always seek legal counsel prior to deciding to ""proffer"" with the government. The U.S. Attorney's Office usually asks the person under investigation or facing prosecution to sign the proffer agreement before the session (interview) starts. The agreement governs the terms of the interview—and when your statements can and cannot be used against you. There are some possible benefits to proffer agreements (see below). However, it is essential to know that such agreements do not offer complete immunity. The government typically cannot use the actual statements one makes from a proffer session in the government's case-in-chief—but it can use the information gleaned to pursue leads for impeachment purposes (refute a subsequent lie) and other investigations. Understanding Proffers in Criminal CasesIn the broader realm of criminal law, a proffer—often called a ""queen for a day immunity"" agreement—can arise when a defendant (or suspect) agrees to provide information about potentially criminal activities in the hope of receiving leniency or other benefits. These benefits might include reduced criminal tax charges, lighter sentencing, or even, in rare cases, immunity. However, proffers in criminal tax cases carry significant criminal tax risks, and it would be wise to understand them completely before entering into one. Defining the Proffer AgreementA proffer is typically a written understanding where a defendant offers information to prosecutors or law enforcement officials. In criminal tax matters, this might involve details of one's own role in a scheme or incriminating information about others involved. While the proffer agreement usually states that the government will not use the defendant's statements against them in its primary case, this protection has multiple exceptions (discussed below). Mechanics of a Proffer AgreementBoth sides—the defendant and the government—sign a formal document. The protection often extends only to direct use of the defendant's statements in the government's case-in-chief, not to derivative leads or if the defendant lies. Any falsity can invalidate the agreement. Moreover, the proffer typically does not guarantee any outcome; it simply opens the door to negotiations, which may or may not yield a favorable deal. Types of Proffers A proffer agreement is embodied in written form by a proffer letter. The agreement allows those who may be subject to a criminal tax investigation, either as a witness or a direct subject of the crime, to ""tell their side"" of the events, with the (alleged) assurance that what they say wil"

(TSXV: NKG) (OTCQB: NKGFF) (""Nevada King"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce it has received a Finding of No Significant Impact, or ""FONSI"", from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as well as approval from the State of Nevada for a minor modification to its existing 45km2 Plan of Operations at the 100%-owned Atlanta Gold Mine Project along the prolific Battle Mountain Trend 264km northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. This is the second modification successfully permitted by the Company and follows receipt of the first plan modification that was issued by the BLM in October 2024. 
Highlights:
 Highlights: Cal Herron, Exploration Manager of Nevada King, stated: ""We are very pleased to see such quick action by the BLM and State of Nevada in finalizing their approvals for this important modification. This new modification adds more holes and new road access in the southern half of the SQRT, while more holes and cross-country travel routes have been added to the Silver Park region. This now allows us to offset existing holes at closer spacings plus follow structural trends seen in the CSAMT data."" QA/QC Protocols All RC samples from the Atlanta Project are split at the drill site and placed in cloth and plastic bags utilizing a nominal 2kg sample weight. CRF standards, blanks, and duplicates are inserted into the sample stream on-site on a one-in-twenty sample basis, meaning all three inserts are included in each 20-sample group. Samples are shipped by a local contractor in large sample shipping crates directly to American Assay Lab in Reno, Nevada, with full custody being maintained at all times. At American Assay Lab, samples were weighted then crushed to 75% passing 2mm and pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns in order to produce a 300g pulverized split. Prepared samples are initially run using a four acid + boric acid digestion process and conventional multi-element ICP-OES analysis. Gold assays are initially run using 30-gram samples by lead fire assay with an OES finish to a 0.003 ppm detection limit, with samples greater than 10 ppm finished gravimetrically. Every sample is also run through a cyanide leach for gold with an ICP-OES finish. The QA/QC procedure involves regular submission of Certified Analytical Standards and property-specific duplicates.

(NYSE: BWA) today reported fourth quarter and full-year results and provided 2025 guidance. Fourth Quarter 2024 and 2025 Guidance Highlights New Business Update The Company secured multiple new business awards that are expected to support its future long-term profitable growth including the following:  Fourth Quarter Highlights (continuing operations basis): Full Year Highlights (continuing operations basis): Financial Results (continuing operations basis): The Company believes the following table is useful in highlighting non-comparable items that impacted its U.S. GAAP net earnings per diluted share. The non-comparable items presented below are calculated after tax using the corresponding effective tax rate discrete to each item and the weighted average number of diluted shares for the periods presented. The Company defines adjusted earnings per diluted share as earnings per diluted share adjusted to eliminate the impact of restructuring expense, merger, acquisition and divestiture expense, other net expenses, discontinued operations, other gains and losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations, and related tax effects.

Net loss for the fourth quarter 2024 was $(403) million, or $(1.84) per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $149 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2023. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2024 were $1.01, up from adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $0.90 for the fourth quarter 2023. Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter 2024 excluded net non-comparable items of $(2.85) per diluted share, while adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter 2023 excluded net non-comparable items of $(0.26) per diluted share. Non-comparable items include $646 million of goodwill and fixed asset impairment charges recorded during the fourth quarter in our PowerDrive Systems and Battery and Charging Systems business units. These and other non-comparable items are listed in the table above, which is provided by the Company for comparison with other results and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. The increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share was primarily due to the impact of higher adjusted operating income and the impact of our share repurchases during 2024, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Full Year 2025 Guidance: The Company has provided 2025 full year guidance. Net sales are expected to be in the range of $13.4 billion to $14.0 billion in 2025, compared with 2024 sales of $14.1 billion. The Company expects its weighted light and commercial vehicle markets to be in the range of down 3.0% to down 1.0% in 2025. The Company's sales guidance implie"

See the ""Non-IFRS Financial       Measures"" section and the tables appended to this news release for additional information on these and other non-IFRS financial      measures, including how they are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable IFRS measures. Revenues increased 5% due to 7% growth in recurring revenues (83% of total revenues) partly offset by a 1% decline in transactions revenues and a 6% decline in Global Print. The net impact of acquisitions and disposals as well as foreign currency on total company revenue growth was not significant.  Operating profit increased 29% driven from gains on the sale of FindLaw and other non-core businesses.    Diluted EPS decreased to $1.30 compared to $1.49 in the prior-year period as higher operating profit and currency benefits included in other finance income or costs were more than offset by higher tax expense, lower results from discontinued operations and a prior-year period increase in the value of the company's former investment in London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).    Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $141 million primarily due to certain component changes in working capital.

Captura opens new Direct Ocean Capture pilot plant in Hawaii,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/captura-opens-new-direct-ocean-capture-pilot-plant-in-hawaii-302369607.html,2025-02-06 16:30:00,"Capable of capturing 1,000 tons of CO2 annually, the facility readies Captura's technology for large-scale deployment LOS ANGELES, Feb. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Captura, a California-based carbon removal company, today announced the start of operations at its latest pilot plant, capable of capturing 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually.  Located in Kona, Hawaii, and developed in partnership with multinational energy company Equinor, the facility marks a major milestone in the commercialization of Direct Ocean Capture (DOC) technology – a process that leverages the ocean to remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere. As the third and final pilot in Captura's technology development program, this facility readies the company's DOC technology for deployment in large, commercial systems worldwide. The ocean is one of the world's largest carbon sinks, absorbing approximately 30 per cent of global CO2 emissions. DOC technology works by extracting CO2 directly from the upper ocean, thereby enhancing the ocean's natural ability to absorb additional CO2 from the atmosphere. By leveraging natural oceanic processes, requiring no feedstock, and generating no waste, the DOC approach to carbon removal offers an inherently scalable and efficient way to remove vast quantities of atmospheric CO2. Captura's DOC technology achieves this by combining innovations in electrodialysis and gas extraction with widely available water and gas handling systems. These modular technologies have been successfully demonstrated at two prior pilot plants in Los Angeles, and the Hawaii pilot will now validate them at the scale and performance level that can be replicated in larger plants. Captura is proceeding with initial design work for its first large-scale commercial facility, with an expected annual capture capacity of tens of thousands of tons of CO2. ""Captura's journey from lab-scale testing to our third technology demonstration in just three years is a testament to the scalability of our solution,"" said Steve Oldham, CEO of Captura. ""This facility in Hawaii is the last milestone before we move to widespread commercial deployment of DOC technology. Its rapid installation and commissioning in just over two months demonstrates how our simple, modular design is ready to be scaled quickly to help address the urgent climate and energy challenge."" DOC is a flexible technology that can serve a variety of climate and industrial use cases. The CO2 extracted at DOC facilities is delivered as a measurable stream of pipeline-purity CO2 gas, which can then be directly sequestered to create carbon dioxide removal, used as a feedstock to produce renewable fuels, or utilized by industries that require CO2. In Hawaii, the CO2 captured at the Captura plant will be provided to a range of local industries, such as aquaculture operators, to help reduce the carbon intensity of their operations. Captura's facility is operating at the Hawai'i Ocean Science and Technology (HOST) Park, a leading ocean research facility run by the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA). NELHA has administered the park in Kona for more than 50 years, generating almost $150 million annually for Hawaii's economy and creating over 600 jobs statewide. NELHA runs a comprehensive environmental monitoring program at HOST Park, which complements Captura's own practices and research on ocean health. Captura's technology is designed to be highly scalable and cost-effective while prioritizing the protection of the ocean ecosystem. The process produces zero waste or by-products and introduces nothing new into the ocean—it simply removes excess CO2, which the atmosphere then naturally replaces. To learn more about Captura, visit www.capturacorp.com. About Captura:Captura is a Direct Ocean Capture company headquartered in Pasadena, California. Captura combines innovative technology with the natural carbon removal powers of the ocean to remove CO2 from the atmosphere at large scale and low-cost, pro"

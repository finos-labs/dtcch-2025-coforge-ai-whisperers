This provider is renowned for its high-quality, reliable, and technologically advanced products, which are widely favored by dental professionals and patients alike.     John Armstrong, Executive Vice President of LPC, commented: “This order underscores the exceptional customer satisfaction CMS Laser delivers to the dentistry market and highlights the increasing demand for accessible, cutting-edge dental solutions. This success is a testament to the strategic value of our recent acquisition.”   The order is for a Robotic-Feed Dental Drill Bit Marking System, designed for high-speed, non-contact, automated marking with unparalleled clarity, durability, and microscopic precision.

The systems are programmed using CMS Laser’s proprietary software, offering intuitive and efficient control.

Zilovertamab vedotin is Merck’s investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1). Global recruitment of the waveLINE-010 trial has begun, with patients now enrolling.   “Following the encouraging results observed in the Phase 2 waveLINE-007 trial, we look forward to evaluating the potential clinical benefits of a combination regimen with zilovertamab vedotin in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma compared to the current standard treatment,” said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, vice president, oncology clinical research, Merck Research Laboratories. “ADCs have shown promise as an important modality in the treatment of different cancer types, and the initiation of this Phase 3 waveLINE clinical trial demonstrates our commitment to researching zilovertamab vedotin to help address unmet needs for patients with this aggressive and most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.”   WaveLINE-010 is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06717347), which is enrolling an estimated 1,046 patients globally. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints include complete response (CR) rate at the end of the treatment, overall survival, event-free survival, duration of CR and safety.   Zilovertamab vedotin is currently being evaluated in the Phase 2/3 waveLINE-003 dose confirmation and expansion trial (NCT05139017) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL and in the Phase 2 waveLINE-007 trial (NCT05406401) in combination with R-CHP in patients with previously untreated DLBCL. Merck recently presented data from this trial for the first time at the 66th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2024.   About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  Lymphoma is cancer beginning in the lymphatic system – the network of organs, vessels and tissues that protects the body from infection. There are many subtypes of lymphoma, which is often categorized into two main types – Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common form of NHL, is derived from white blood cells that grow rapidly and uncontrollably, enlarging the lymph nodes and often migrating to other parts of the body. DLBCL accounts for approximately 25-30% of all NHLs worldwide. In the U.S., it is estimated that approximately 25,000 patients are diagnosed with DLBCL each year. The five-year relative survival rate for DLBCL is 60-70%.   About zilovertamab vedotin (MK-2140)  Zilovertamab vedotin is an investigational ADC that targets ROR1. ROR1 is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in multiple hematologic malignancies. Merck is committed to research with zilovertamab vedotin across B-cell malignancies and is establishing a robust program of clinical trials under the name waveLINE. The waveLINE program includes a Phase 2/3 study in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL (waveLINE-003, NCT05139017) and a Phase 2 study in patients with previously untreated DLBCL (waveLINE-007, NCT05406401).   About Merck in hematology  Merck is committed to advancing innovation and care for people with hematologic neoplasms and malignancies. Building on its leadership in oncology, the company has a broad clinical development program that evaluates novel mechanisms of action to address longstanding unmet needs for patients with hematologic disorders.

collateralized financing entities (“CFEs”). These assets can only be used to settle obligations and liabilities of such VIEs for which creditors do not have recourse to Rithm Capital Corp.      NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP NET INCOME  The Company has four primary variables that impact its performance: (i) net interest margin on assets held within the investment portfolio; (ii) realized and unrealized gains or losses on assets held within the investment portfolio and operating companies, including any impairment or reserve for expected credit losses; (iii) income from the Company’s operating company investments; and (iv) the Company’s operating expenses and taxes.   “Earnings available for distribution” is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company’s operating performance, which is used by management to evaluate the Company’s performance, excluding: (i) net realized and unrealized gains and losses on certain assets and liabilities; (ii) net other income and losses; (iii) non-capitalized transaction-related expenses; and (iv) deferred taxes.   The Company’s definition of earnings available for distribution excludes certain realized and unrealized losses, which although they represent a part of the Company’s recurring operations, are subject to significant variability and are generally limited to a potential indicator of future economic performance. Within net other income and losses, management primarily excludes (i) equity-based compensation expenses, (ii) non-cash deferred interest expense and (iii) amortization expense related to intangible assets, as management does not consider this non-cash activity to be a component of earnings available for distribution. With regard to non-capitalized transaction-related expenses, management does not view these costs as part of the Company’s core operations, as they are considered by management to be similar to realized losses incurred at acquisition. Management also excludes amortization of acquisition premium on residential transition loans. Management also excludes bargain purchase gain resulting from business acquisitions as it is not a recurring activity and it is not part of the Company’s core operations. Non-capitalized transaction related expenses generally relate to legal and valuation service costs, as well as other professional service fees, incurred when the Company acquires certain investments, as well as costs associated with the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses. Management also excludes deferred taxes because the Company believes deferred taxes are not representative of current operations.   Management believes that the adjustments to compute “earnings available for distribution” specified above allow investors and analysts to readily identify and track the operating performance of the assets that form the core of the Company’s activity, assist in comparing the core operating results between periods and enable investors to evaluate the Company’s current core performance using the same financial measure that management uses to operate the business. Management also utilizes earnings available for distribution as a financial measure in its decision-making process relating to improvements to the underlying fundamental operations of the Company’s investments, as well as the allocation of resources between those investments, and management also relies on earnings available for distribution as an indicator of the results of such decisions. Earnings available for distribution excludes certain recurring items, such as gains and losses (including impairment and reserves as well as derivative activities) and non-capitalized transaction-related expenses, because they are not considered by management to be part of the Company’s core operations for the reasons described herein. As such, earnings available for distribution is not intended to reflect all of the Company’s activity and should be considered as only one of the factors used by management in assessing the Company’s performance, along with GAAP net income which is inclusive of all of the Company’s activities.   The Company views earnings available for distribution as a consistent financial measure of its portfolio’s ability to generate income for distribution to common stockholders. Earnings available for distribution does not represent and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, net income or as a substitute for, or superior to, cash flows from operating activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP, and the Company’s calculation of this financial measure may not be comparable to similarly entitled financial measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, to maintain qualification as a REIT, U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that the Company distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income annually, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. Because the Company views earnings available for distribution as a consistent financial measure of its ability to generate income for distribution to common stockholders, earnings available for distribution is one metric, but not the exclusive metric, that the Company’s board of directors uses to determine the amount, if any, and the payment date of dividends on common stock. However, earnings available for distribution should not be considered as an indication of the Company’s taxable income, a guaranty of its ability to pay dividends or as a proxy for the amount of dividends it may pay, as earnings available for distribution excludes certain items that impact its cash needs.

Non-GAAP Reconciliation  During the second fiscal quarter of 2025, Tapestry recorded certain items that decreased the Company’s pre-tax income by $198 million, net income by $140 million, and earnings per diluted share by $0.62. These items are due to acquisition costs, primarily relating to debt extinguishment, expense reimbursement, financing, and professional fees.   Please refer to the Financial Schedules included herein for a full reconciliation of the Company’s reported GAAP to non-GAAP results.   Financial Outlook  Tapestry is raising its Fiscal 2025 outlook, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. The Company now expects:    Revenue of over $6.85 billion, representing growth of approximately 3% versus prior year on a reported basis, including an expected currency headwind of over 50 basis points. This is ahead of prior guidance of approximately 1% to 2% growth versus prior year on a reported and constant currency basis;    Operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points versus prior year as compared to prior guidance of over 50 basis points of expansion;    Net interest expense of approximately $35 million as compared to prior guidance of $20 million of net interest income. The change in outlook reflects the interest on the new bond issuance and a lower cash balance due to the execution of the ASR program;    Tax rate of approximately 17% to 18% versus prior guidance of approximately 19%;    Weighted average diluted share count of approximately 223 million shares as compared to prior guidance of approximately 238 million shares, reflecting the benefit of share repurchase activity;    Earnings per diluted share of $4.85 to $4.90, representing 13% to 14% growth compared to the prior year, and exceeding the Company’s prior guidance of $4.50 to $4.55. The increased outlook incorporates the Company’s second quarter operational outperformance of $0.17, a full year net benefit from share repurchase activity of $0.10, and a net benefit of $0.08 from a favorable tax rate partially offset by an expected currency headwind;    Adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion as compared to the prior outlook of $1.1 billion.    Please note this outlook assumes the following:    No revenue, net interest, or earnings impact related to the terminated acquisition of Capri Holdings Limited;    No further appreciation of the U.S. Dollar; information provided based on spot rates at the time of forecast;    No material worsening of inflationary pressures or consumer confidence;    No benefit from the potential reinstatement of the Generalized System of Preferences (“GSP”); and    No impact related to any future policy changes resulting from the U.S. Presidential Administration change. The Company’s outlook embeds the expectation for an additional 10% tariff on goods imported from China into the U.S. beginning February 4, 2025, which is expected to have an immaterial impact on Fiscal 2025 results.    Given the dynamic nature of these and other external factors, financial results could differ materially from the outlook provided.   Financial Outlook - Non-GAAP Adjustments:   The Company is not able to provide a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP presented in this release and on the Company’s conference call because certain material items that impact these measures have not yet occurred and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.

Management utilizes non-GAAP and constant currency measures to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected and to make decisions about Company resources and performance. The Company believes presenting these non-GAAP measures, which exclude items that are not comparable from period to period, is useful to investors and others in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the Company’s historical performance. Additionally, the Company believes presenting these metrics on a constant currency basis will help investors and analysts to understand the effect of significant year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on these performance measures and provide a framework to assess how business is performing and expected to perform excluding these effects.  The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP measures utilized by the Company may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.  The Company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP. Percentage increases/decreases in net sales for the Company and each segment have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating foreign-denominated sales into U.S. dollars and compared to the same periods in the prior quarter and fiscal year. The Company calculates constant currency net sales results by translating current period net sales in local currency using the prior year period’s currency conversion rate.  The segment operating income and supplemental segment SG&A expenses presented in the Consolidated Segment Data, and GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation Table above, as well as SG&A expense ratio, and operating margin, are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures have been presented both including and excluding acquisition costs for the three and six months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. In addition, Operating Income (loss), Interest expense, Provision for income taxes, Net income (loss), and Net Income (loss) per diluted common share, have been presented both including and excluding acquisition costs for the three and six months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. Loss on extinguishment of debt has been presented both including and excluding acquisition costs for the three and six months ended December 28, 2024.  The Company also presents Adjusted Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, and is calculated by taking Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, plus Items affecting comparability including Acquisition Costs and Changes in operating assets and liabilities of items affecting comparability - Acquisition Costs. The Company believes that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses, investment in our business and items affecting comparability. The Company believes that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it measures the Company’s ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.  The Company also presents Leverage Ratio, which is a non-GAAP metric, and is calculated as total debt, which includes Current debt and Long-term debt, divided by the trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Net Income (Loss), excluding, Interest expense, net, Loss on extinguishment of debt, Provision for income taxes, Depreciation and amortization, Cloud computing amortization, Share-based compensation and Items affecting comparability including Acquisition costs. The Company believes that the Leverage Ratio is an important metric to assess the strength of our balance sheet and credit quality and as a metric showing our commitment to our Investment Grade rating.  Net Debt is calculated as total debt, which includes Current debt and Long-term debt, minus Cash and cash equivalents, minus Short-term investments.

With these strategic actions and continued commercial momentum, we are confident in our ability to drive further long-term growth and deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders.”     1     Represents global vehicle production weighted to the geographic regions in which the Company generates its revenue (“AWM”).      Fourth Quarter 2024 Results  For the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Company reported U.S. GAAP revenue of $4.9 billion, consistent with the prior year period. Adjusted for currency exchange and commodity movements, revenue decreased by 1% in the fourth quarter. This reflects declines of 8% in Europe, partially offset by growth of 3% in North America, 3% in Asia, which includes 4% in China, and flat growth in South America, our smallest region.   The Company reported fourth quarter 2024 U.S. GAAP net income of $268 million, earnings of $1.14 per diluted share and net income margin of 5.5%, compared to $905 million, $3.22 per diluted share and 18.4% in the prior year period. Fourth quarter Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, totaled $411 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, compared to $395 million, or $1.40 per diluted share in the prior year period.   Fourth quarter U.S. GAAP operating income was $479 million, compared to $355 million in the prior year period. The Company reported fourth quarter Adjusted Operating Income, a non-GAAP financial measure defined below, of $623 million, compared to $600 million in the prior year period. Adjusted Operating Income margin was 12.7%, compared to 12.2% in the prior year period, primarily reflecting improved operating performance, including the benefits of cost reduction initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $245 million, compared to $246 million in the prior year period.   Interest expense for the fourth quarter totaled $107 million, an increase from $71 million in the prior year period.   Tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $64 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 18%. Tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $680 million, which primarily reflects the recognition of a deferred tax benefit of approximately $723 million as a result of transactions entered into as part of a reorganization of the Company’s corporate entity structure.   The Company generated net cash flow from operating activities of $1,060 million in fourth quarter, compared to $624 million in the prior year period.   Full Year 2024 Results  For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company reported U.S. GAAP revenue of $19.7 billion, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. Adjusted for currency exchange and commodity movements, revenue decreased by 2% in 2024. This reflects declines of 4% in Europe, 1% in North America and 9% in South America, our smallest region, partially offset by growth of 1% in Asia, which includes 2% in China.   The Company reported full year 2024 U.S. GAAP net income of $1,787 million, earnings of $6.96 per diluted share and net income margin of 9.1%, compared to $2,909 million, $10.39 per diluted share and 14.5% in the prior year.

Adjusted Operating Income margin was 12.0%, compared to 10.6% in the prior year, primarily reflecting improved operating performance, including the benefits of cost reduction initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $964 million, an increase from $912 million in the prior year.   Interest expense for full year 2024 totaled $337 million, as compared to $285 million in the prior year, which primarily reflects the impacts of debt transactions in the third quarter of 2024 in part to finance our $3.0 billion accelerated share repurchase program.   Tax expense for full year 2024 was $223 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 10%. Tax benefit for full year 2023 was $1,928 million, which primarily reflects the recognition of a deferred tax benefit of approximately $2.1 billion as a result of transactions entered into as part of a reorganization of the Company’s corporate entity structure.

Planned Spin-off of Electrical Distribution Systems Business  As previously announced on January 22, 2025, Aptiv intends to execute a tax-free spin-off of its Electrical Distribution Systems business into a new, independent publicly traded company, creating two highly focused public companies strategically positioned to drive incremental value for customers, shareholders and employees. The transaction is expected to be completed by March 31, 2026.   In connection with the planned spin-off of the Company’s Electrical Distribution Systems business, in the first quarter of 2025 Aptiv is realigning its business into three reportable operating segments: Electrical Distribution Systems, Engineered Components Group and Advanced Safety and User Experience.

Conference Call and Webcast  The Company will host a conference call to discuss these results at 8:00 a.m. (ET) today, which is accessible by dialing +1.800.239.9838 (US) or +1.323.794.2423 (international) or through a webcast at ir.aptiv.com.

A replay will be available two hours following the conference call.   Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information  This press release contains information about Aptiv’s financial results which are not presented in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, Adjusted Revenue Growth, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Revenue Growth represents the year-over-year change in reported net sales relative to the comparable period, excluding the impact on net sales from currency exchange, commodity movements, acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions. Adjusted Operating Income represents net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax (expense) benefit, equity income (loss), net of tax, amortization, restructuring, other acquisition and portfolio project costs, (which includes costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and to plan and execute product portfolio transformation actions, including business and product acquisitions and divestitures), asset impairments and other related charges, compensation expense related to acquisitions and gains (losses) on business divestitures and other transactions. Adjusted Operating Income margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before depreciation and amortization (including asset impairments), interest expense, income tax (expense) benefit, other income (expense), net, equity income (loss), net of tax, restructuring and other special items.   Adjusted Net Income represents net income attributable to Aptiv before amortization, restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon. Adjusted Net Income Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the Weighted Average Number of Diluted Shares Outstanding for the period. Cash Flow Before Financing represents cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities, adjusted for the purchase price of business acquisitions and other transactions, the cost of significant technology investments and net proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations and other significant businesses.   Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In particular, management believes Adjusted Revenue Growth, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are useful measures in assessing the Company’s ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes.   Such non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the attached supplemental schedules at the end of this press release. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Adjusted Revenue Growth: Adjusted Revenue Growth is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s financial performance which management believes is useful to investors in assessing the Company’s ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance and which may obscure underlying business results and trends. Our management utilizes Adjusted Revenue Growth in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Adjusted Revenue Growth is defined as the year-over-year change in reported net sales relative to the comparable period, excluding the impact on net sales from currency exchange, commodity movements, acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted Revenue Growth, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.           Three Months Ended December 31, 2024                    Reported net sales % change     —     %       Less: foreign currency exchange and commodities     1     %       Adjusted revenue growth     (1     )%                           Year Ended December 31, 2024                    Reported net sales % change     (2     )%       Less: foreign currency exchange and commodities     —     %       Adjusted revenue growth     (2     )%      Adjusted Operating Income: Adjusted Operating Income is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s financial performance which management believes is useful to investors in assessing the Company’s ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance and which may obscure underlying business results and trends. Our management utilizes Adjusted Operating Income in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Management also utilizes Adjusted Operating Income as the key performance measure of segment income or loss and for planning and forecasting purposes to allocate resources to our segments, as management also believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments. Adjusted Operating Income is defined as net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax (expense) benefit, equity income (loss), net of tax, amortization, restructuring and other special items. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted Operating Income, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Operating income margin represents Operating income as a percentage of net sales, and Adjusted Operating Income margin represents Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of net sales.

Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s financial performance which management believes is useful to investors in assessing the Company’s ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance and which may obscure underlying business results and trends. Our management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before depreciation and amortization (including asset impairments), interest expense, income tax (expense) benefit, other income (expense), net, equity income (loss), net of tax, restructuring and other special items. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted EBITDA, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.           Three Months Ended          Year Ended            December 31,          December 31,                  2024                      2023                      2024                      2023                  (in millions)      Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders     $     268                 $     905                 $     1,787                 $     2,909             Mandatory convertible preferred share dividends           —                       —                       —                       29             Net income attributable to Aptiv     $     268                 $     905                 $     1,787                 $     2,938             Interest expense           107                       71                       337                       285             Income tax expense (benefit)           64                       (680     )                 223                       (1,928     )       Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest           6                       13                       24                       28             Net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest           1                       1                       (1     )                 —             Depreciation and amortization           245                       246                       964                       912             EBITDA     $     691                 $     556                 $     3,334                 $     2,235             Other income, net           (11     )                 (27     )                 (41     )                 (63     )       Net loss (gain) on equity method transactions           36                       —                       (605     )                 —             Equity loss, net of tax           8                       72                       118                       299             Restructuring           68                       130                       193                       211             Other acquisition and portfolio project costs           14                       35                       80                       80             Compensation expense related to acquisitions           5                       6                       18                       26             Adjusted EBITDA     $     811                 $     772                 $     3,097                 $     2,788            Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share: Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share, which are non-GAAP measures, are presented as supplemental measures of the Company’s financial performance which management believes are useful to investors in assessing the Company’s ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance and which may obscure underlying business results and trends.

For purposes of calculating Adjusted Net Income Per Share, the Company has excluded the impact of the MCPS dividends for the year ended December 31, 2023 and assumed the “if converted” method of share dilution as the assumed conversion of the MCPS into ordinary shares on a weighted average basis was more dilutive to net income per share than the impact of the MCPS dividends (method already applied for U.S. GAAP purposes of calculating the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding).       (b)     In response to the OECD’s Pillar Two Directive, the Company initiated changes to its corporate entity structure, including intercompany transfers of certain intellectual property to one of its subsidiaries in Switzerland during the second half of 2023. Furthermore, during the third quarter, the Company’s Swiss subsidiary was granted a ten year tax incentive, beginning in 2024. The measurement of certain deferred tax assets and associated income tax benefits resulting from these transactions was impacted by tax legislation in Switzerland enacted in the fourth quarter of 2023, which increased the statutory income tax rate, resulting in additional deferred tax benefit impacts, net of valuation allowances. These adjustments represent the total income tax benefits recorded as a result of these transactions during the three months and year ended December 31, 2023.       (c)     Represents the income tax impacts of the adjustments made for amortization, restructuring and other special items by calculating the income tax impact of these items using the appropriate tax rate for the jurisdiction where the charges were incurred.      Cash Flow Before Financing: Cash Flow Before Financing is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company’s liquidity which is consistent with the basis and manner in which management presents financial information for the purpose of making internal operating decisions, evaluating its liquidity and determining appropriate capital allocation strategies. Management believes this measure is useful to investors to understand how the Company’s core operating activities generate and use cash. Cash Flow Before Financing is defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities, adjusted for the purchase price of business acquisitions and other transactions, the cost of significant technology investments and net proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations and other significant businesses. Not all companies use identical calculations of Cash Flow Before Financing, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The calculation of Cash Flow Before Financing does not reflect cash used to service debt, pay dividends or repurchase shares and, therefore, does not necessarily reflect funds available for investment or other discretionary uses.           Three Months Ended          Year Ended            December 31,          December 31,                  2024                      2023                      2024

Kenvue Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2024 Results,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206360285/en/Kenvue-Reports-Full-Year-and-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Results,2025-02-06 12:15:00," SKILLMAN, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kenvue Inc. (NYSE: KVUE), today announced financial results for the full year and fiscal fourth quarter ended December 29, 2024.     “We delivered on our 2024 profit commitments despite headwinds that resulted in softer than expected sales growth and we enter 2025 as a more competitive company with stronger foundations,” said Thibaut Mongon, Chief Executive Officer. “We remain focused on leveraging our increased brand investments to accelerate growth and deliver long-term value creation centered around profitable growth, durable cash flow generation, and disciplined capital allocation.”   Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results  Net Sales and Organic Sales  Fourth quarter Net sales decreased 0.1%, reflecting Organic sales1 growth of 1.7% and a foreign currency headwind of 1.8%. Organic sales growth was driven by 1.0% value realization (price and mix) and 0.7% volume growth.   Value realization was favorable across each segment and was primarily driven by price actions taken in 2024. Volume growth in both Skin Health and Beauty and Self Care was partially offset by a decline in Essential Health. In Self Care, weak incidences of cold, cough & flu led to a significant decline in the pediatric pain franchise. In addition, go-to-market disruption in Asia Pacific impacted the Company’s results, with an outsized impact on Essential Health.   Gross Profit Margin and Operating Income Margin  Fourth quarter Gross profit margin expanded 80 basis points to 56.5% from 55.7% in the prior year period, as Separation-related costs and amortization of intangible assets declined year-over-year. Adjusted gross profit margin1 decreased 80 basis points to 58.7% from 59.5% in the prior year period, which included non-recurring separation related benefits. The year-over-year change in both measures also reflects the impact from net input cost inflation and unfavorable mix, as well as the benefit from productivity gains and value realization.   Fourth quarter Operating income margin was 13.2% vs 12.5% in the prior year period. Fourth quarter Adjusted operating income margin1 was 19.2% vs 21.8% in the prior year period. The year-over-year changes in Operating income margin and Adjusted operating income margin reflect the year-over-year change in Gross profit margin and Adjusted gross profit margin, respectively, as well as an increase in brand investment and the benefit from savings from Our Vue Forward.   Interest Expense, Net and Taxes  Fourth quarter Interest expense, net was $95 million vs $96 million in the prior year period.   The fourth quarter Effective tax rate was 15.3% vs 8.4% in the prior year period. The Adjusted effective tax rate1 was 17.7% vs 15.8% in the prior year period. Both measures were driven by changes to the jurisdictional mix of income and reduced benefits derived from the separation from our former parent company offset by remeasurement of the Company’s deferred taxes and the release of a valuation allowance.   Net Income Per Share (“Earnings Per Share”)  Fourth quarter Diluted earnings per share were $0.15 vs $0.17 in the prior year period and Adjusted diluted earnings per share1 were $0.26 vs $0.31 in the prior year period.   Full Year 2024 Financial Results  Net Sales and Organic Sales  Full year 2024 Net sales increased 0.1%, reflecting Organic sales growth of 1.5% and foreign currency headwind of 1.4%. Organic sales growth was driven by 2.7% value realization, partially offset by 1.2% volume decline.   Value realization was favorable across each segment and was driven by a combination of carry-over pricing from 2023 and price actions taken in 2024. The volume decline was driven by Skin Health and Beauty and Self Care, which offset slight volume growth in Essential Health.   Gross Profit Margin and Operating Income Margin  Full year 2024 Gross profit margin expanded 200 basis points to 58.0% from 56.0% in the prior year period. Adjusted gross profit margin also expanded 200 basis points to 60.4% from 58.4% in the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement in both measures primarily reflects productivity gains attributable to our global supply chain efficiency initiatives and benefits from value realization.   Full year 2024 Operating income margin was 11.9% vs 16.3% in the prior year period, with the current year figure impacted by non-cash charges related to asset impairments. Full year 2024 Adjusted operating income margin was 21.5% vs 22.4% in the prior year period. The year-over-year change in both measures reflects the impact of higher brand investment, which more than offset the benefit from Gross profit margin expansion and savings from Our Vue Forward.   Interest Expense, Net and Taxes  Full year 2024 Interest expense, net was $378 million vs $250 million in the prior year period.   Full year Effective tax rate was 27.2% vs 24.0% in the prior year period. The Adjusted effective tax rate was 25.5% vs 23.4% in the prior year period. Both measures were driven by changes to the jurisdictional mix of income and reduced benefits derived from the separation from our former parent company offset by remeasurement of the Company’s deferred taxes and the release of a valuation allowance.   Net Income Per Share (“Earnings Per Share”)  Full year 2024 Diluted earnings per share were $0.54 vs $0.90 in the prior year period and Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.14 vs $1.29 in the prior year period.   2025 Outlook  “As Kenvue enters our next chapter, we expect to accelerate performance throughout the year, while navigating the dynamic external environment contemplated within our outlook,” said Paul Ruh, Chief Financial Officer. “We expect to drive further productivity and operational efficiency gains, which will fund our planned increase in brand investments, positioning us to grow adjusted operating margin for the year.""   Based on current spot rates, Kenvue initiated the following outlook for Full year 2025. The Company expects:    Net sales change of -1% to +1% year-over-year, with Organic sales growth of +2% to +4% and a ~3% headwind from foreign currency translation.    Adjusted operating income margin improvement year-over-year.    Flat to +2% year-over-year Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth, including a mid-single-digit unfavorable impact from foreign currency.    This outlook does not include any potential impacts from tariffs introduced in 2025.   Kenvue is not able to provide the most directly comparable GAAP measures or reconcile Adjusted operating income margin or Adjusted diluted earnings per share to comparable GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts given the unpredictability of the timing and amounts of discrete items such as foreign exchange, acquisitions, or divestitures.   Webcast Information  As previously announced, Kenvue will host a conference call with investors to discuss its fourth quarter and full year results on Thursday, February 6, 2025 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The conference call can be accessed by dialing 877-407-8835 from the U.S. or +1 201-689-8779 from international locations.

There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented herein. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP nor do they have any standardized meaning under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way the Company calculates such measures. Accordingly, the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to such similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplements to, not substitutes for, or superior to, the corresponding financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.   The Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management. The Company believes these measures help improve investors’ ability to understand the Company’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company’s results with other companies. In addition, the Company believes these measures are also among the primary measures used externally by the Company’s investors, analysts, and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in our industry.   Below are definitions and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures for the non-GAAP measures used in this press release and the related prepared materials and webcast.   Adjusted diluted earnings per share: We define Adjusted diluted earnings per share as Adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Management views this non-GAAP measure as useful to investors as it provides a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance over time.   Adjusted EBITDA margin: We define EBITDA as U.S. GAAP Net income adjusted for interest, provision for taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for restructuring expenses and operating model optimization initiatives, costs incurred in connection with our establishment as a standalone public company (“Separation-related costs”), conversion of stock-based awards, stock-based awards granted to individuals employed by Kenvue as of October 2, 2023 (“Founder Shares”), impairment charges, the impact of the deferred transfer of certain assets and liabilities from Johnson & Johnson in certain jurisdictions (the “Deferred Markets”), litigation (income) expense, losses on investments, and tax indemnification releases. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of U.S. GAAP Net sales. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors as it provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time.   Adjusted effective tax rate: We define Adjusted effective tax rate as U.S. GAAP Effective tax rate adjusted for the tax effects on special item adjustments including amortization of intangible assets, restructuring expenses and operating model optimization initiatives, Separation-related costs, conversion of stock-based awards, Founder Shares, impairment charges other than the Dr.Ci:Labo® asset impairment, litigation (income) expense, losses on investments, interest income from a related party note, and tax indemnification releases. We also exclude taxes related to the Deferred Markets, taxes related to the Dr.Ci:Labo® asset impairment charges, certain one-time tax only adjustments which includes the removal of tax effects from the carve-out methodology, and the impact of the interest expense from the debt issuance, which reduced the Company’s capacity to utilize foreign tax credits against U.S. foreign source income. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors as it provides a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance over time.   Adjusted gross profit margin: We define Adjusted gross profit margin (also referred to as “Adjusted gross margin”) as U.S. GAAP Gross profit margin adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, Separation-related costs, conversion of stock-based awards, Founder Shares, and operating model optimization initiatives. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors as it provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time.   Adjusted net income: We define Adjusted net income as U.S. GAAP Net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, restructuring expenses and operating model optimization initiatives, Separation-related costs, conversion of stock-based awards, Founder Shares, impairment charges, the impact of the Deferred Markets, litigation (income) expense, losses on investments, interest income from a related party note, tax indemnification releases, and their related tax impacts (i.e. special items). Adjusted net income excludes the impact of items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors as the Company uses Adjusted net income for strategic decision making, forecasting future results, and evaluating current performance.   Adjusted operating income: We define Adjusted operating income as U.S. GAAP Operating income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, restructuring expenses and operating model optimization initiatives, Separation-related costs, conversion of stock-based awards, Founder Shares, impairment charges, the impact of the Deferred Markets, and litigation (income) expense. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors as management uses Adjusted operating income to assess the Company’s financial performance.   Adjusted operating income margin: We define Adjusted operating income margin (also referred to as “Adjusted operating margin”) as Adjusted operating income as a percentage of U.S. GAAP Net sales. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors as it provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time.   Free cash flow: We define Free cash flow as U.S. GAAP Net cash flows from operating activities adjusted for Purchases of property, plant, and equipment. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors as it provides a view of the Company’s liquidity after deducting capital expenditures, which are considered a necessary component of our ongoing operations.   Organic sales: We define Organic sales as U.S. GAAP Net sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. We report changes in Organic sales on a period-over-period basis. We previously referred to this non-GAAP financial metric as “Organic growth”. Management believes reporting period-over-period changes in Organic sales provides investors with additional, supplemental information that is useful in assessing the Company’s results of operations by excluding the impact of certain items that we believe do not directly reflect our underlying operations.   The non-GAAP measures as presented herein have been prepared as if our operations had been conducted independently from Johnson & Johnson prior to May 4, 2023, the date Kenvue’s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and therefore they include certain Johnson & Johnson corporate and shared costs allocated to us. Management believes the cost allocations are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to, or the benefit derived by, us during the periods presented, though the allocations may not be indicative of the actual costs that would have been incurred if we had been operating as a standalone company.   Cautions Concerning Forward-Looking Statements  This press release contains “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding, among other things, statements about management’s expectations of Kenvue’s future operating and financial performance, product development, market position, and business strategy. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” and other words of similar meaning. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations of future events. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of Kenvue and its affiliates. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the inability to execute on Kenvue’s business development strategy; inflation and other economic factors, such as interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the ability to successfully manage local, regional, or global economic volatility, including reduced market growth rates, and to generate sufficient income and cash flow to allow Kenvue to effect any expected share repurchases and dividend payments; Kenvue’s ability to maintain satisfactory credit ratings and access capital markets, which could adversely affect its liquidity, capital position, and borrowing costs; competition, including technological advances, new products, and intellectual property attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product research and development; uncertainty of commercial success for new and existing products and digital capabilities; challenges to intellectual property protections including counterfeiting; the ability of Kenvue to successfully execute strategic plans, including Our Vue Forward and other restructuring or cost-saving initiatives; the impact of business combinations and divestitures, including any ongoing or future transactions; manufacturing difficulties or delays, internally or within the supply chain; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or regulatory action; significant adverse litigation or government action, including related to product liability claims; changes to applicable laws and regulations and other requirements imposed by stakeholders; changes in behavior and spending patterns of consumers; natural disasters, acts of war (including the Russia-Ukraine War and the Israel-Hamas War), or terrorism, catastrophes, or epidemics, pandemics, or other disease outbreaks; financial instability of international economies and legal systems and sovereign risk; the inability to realize the benefits of the separation from Kenvue’s former parent, Johnson & Johnson; and the risk of disruption or unanticipated costs in connection with the separation. A further list and descriptions of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in Kenvue’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings, available at www.kenvue.com or on request from Kenvue.

Darling Ingredients Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Results,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206441697/en/Darling-Ingredients-Inc.-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Results,2025-02-06 12:15:00," IRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE: DAR) today reported net income of $101.9 million, or $0.63 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $84.5 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. The company continued its focus on operational excellence, which resulted in gross margin improvement in fourth quarter 2024, compared to third quarter 2024, despite lower fat prices. The company also reported total net sales of $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with total net sales of $1.6 billion for the same period a year ago, reflecting lower finished product pricing.   “Darling Ingredients delivered its strongest quarter of the year, and delivered some notable milestones,” said Randall C. Stuewe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We started up one of the world’s largest sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) units in Port Arthur, Texas, which is now debt free, and the joint venture delivered meaningful dividends throughout the year. We integrated several acquisitions around the world that position the company well for future growth adapting to global market dynamics.”   For fiscal year ended Dec. 28, 2024, Darling Ingredients reported net sales of $5.7 billion, compared to net sales of $6.8 billion for the same period in 2023. Net income for fiscal year 2024 was $278.9 million, or $1.73 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $647.7 million, or $3.99 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2023.   DGD sold 293.8 million gallons of renewable diesel for the fourth quarter 2024 at an average of $0.40 per gallon EBITDA. Darling Ingredients received $68.6 million in cash dividends from DGD during the fourth quarter of 2024. For full year 2024, DGD sold 1.25 billion gallons at an average of $0.46 per gallon EBITDA.   Combined Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $289.5 million, compared to $350.9 million for the same period in 2023. For fiscal year 2024, Combined Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.08 billion, as compared to $1.61 billion for the same period in 2023.   As of Dec. 28, 2024, Darling Ingredients had $76.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $1.16 billion available under its committed revolving credit agreement. Total debt outstanding as of Dec. 28, 2024, was $4.0 billion. The preliminary leverage ratio as measured by the company’s bank covenant was 3.93X as of Dec. 28, 2024. Capital expenditures were $73.3 million for the fourth quarter 2024, and $332.5 million for the year.   “Global raw material volumes remain robust and stronger fat prices in the first quarter of 2025 should provide lift as pending tariffs and the Clean Fuel Production Credit provide greater certainty to the value of domestic feedstocks,” Stuewe said. “Currently, we expect 2025 to be stronger than 2024, gaining momentum throughout the year as DGD turnarounds are completed and SAF sales command a larger percentage of our mix.”   Given fourth quarter 2024 run rates and only one period into the new year, the company is providing guidance of $1.25 to $1.30 billion Combined Adjusted EBITDA and will provide updates as the year progresses.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:  Segment Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized accounting measurement under GAAP; it should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss), as a measure of operating results, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. It is presented here not as an alternative to net income (loss), but rather as a measure of the segment’s operating performance. Segment Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income/(loss) plus depreciation and amortization, restructuring and asset impairment charges, acquisition and integration costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration, foreign currency loss/(gain), net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, income tax provision, other income/(expense), equity in net (income)/loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries and equity in net (income)/loss of Diamond Green Diesel. Management believes that Segment Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating the segment’s operating performance because the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates non-cash and certain other items for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance and also believes this information is useful to investors.   Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized accounting measurement under GAAP; it should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as a measure of operating results, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. It is presented here not as an alternative to net income, but rather as a measure of the Company's operating performance. Since EBITDA (generally, net income plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is not calculated identically by all companies, the presentation in this report may not be comparable to EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA presentations disclosed by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated above and represents for any relevant period, net income/(loss) plus depreciation and amortization, restructuring and asset impairment charges, acquisition and integration costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration, foreign currency loss/(gain), net income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, interest expense, income tax provision, other income/(expense) and equity in net (income)/loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes, non-cash and certain other items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance and also believes this information is useful to investors.   The Company’s management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure to evaluate performance and for other discretionary purposes. In addition to the foregoing, management also uses or will use Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with certain financial covenants under the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities, 6% Notes, 5.25% Notes and 3.625% Notes that were outstanding at December 28, 2024. However, the amounts shown above for Adjusted EBITDA differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities, 6% Notes, 5.25% Notes and 3.625% Notes, as those definitions permit further adjustments to reflect certain other nonrecurring costs, non-cash charges and cash dividends from the DGD Joint Venture. Additionally, the Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange on operating cash flow, which is defined as segment operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization.   Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency is not a recognized accounting measurement under GAAP; it should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as a measure of operating results, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. It is presented here not as an alternative to net income, but rather as a measure of the Company's operating performance. Management believes Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency is useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance on a constant currency basis and also believes this information is useful to investors.   Combined Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized accounting measurement under GAAP; it should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as a measure of operating results, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. It is presented here not as an alternative to net income, but rather as a measure of the Company’s operating performance. Combined Adjusted EBITDA consists of Adjusted EBITDA plus DGD Adjusted EBITDA (Darling’s Share). When Combined Adjusted EBITDA is presented by segment, Combined Adjusted EBITDA consists of Segment Adjusted EBITDA plus DGD Adjusted EBITDA (Darling’s Share). Management believes that Combined Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of Combined Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes, non-cash and certain other items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance and also believes this information is useful to investors.   Information reconciling forward-looking Combined Adjusted EBITDA to net income is unavailable to the Company without unreasonable effort. The Company is not able to provide reconciliations of Combined Adjusted EBITDA to net income because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the impact of volatile commodity prices on the Company’s operations, impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, depreciation and amortization and the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such reconciliations for Darling Ingredients Inc. and the Company’s joint venture, Diamond Green Diesel, would require a forward-looking balance sheet, statement of operations and statement of cash flows, prepared in accordance with GAAP for each entity, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to the Company without unreasonable effort. The Company provides guidance for its Combined Adjusted EBITDA outlook that it believes will be achieved; however, it cannot accurately predict all the components of the Combined Adjusted EBITDA calculation.   DGD Adjusted EBITDA is not reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA or the Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to Foreign Currency. DGD Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized accounting measure under GAAP; it should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss) or equity in net income/(loss) of Diamond Green Diesel, as a measure of operating results, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity and is not intended to be a presentation in accordance with GAAP. The Company calculates DGD Adjusted EBITDA by taking DGD’s net income/(loss) plus income tax expense/(benefit), interest and debt expense, net, and DGD’s depreciation, amortization and accretion expense less other income. Management believes that DGD Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because the calculation of DGD Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates non-cash and certain other items at DGD unrelated to overall operating performance and also believes this information is useful to investors. The Company calculates Darling’s Share of DGD Adjusted EBITDA by taking DGD Adjusted EBITDA and then multiplying by 50% to get Darling’s Share of DGD’s Adjusted EBITDA.   EBITDA per gallon is not a recognized accounting measurement under GAAP; it should not be considered as an alternative to net income or equity in income of Diamond Green Diesel, as a measure of operating results, or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity and is not intended to be a presentation in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA per gallon is presented here not as an alternative to net income or equity in income of Diamond Green Diesel, but rather as a measure of Diamond Green Diesel's operating performance. Since EBITDA per gallon (generally, net income plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization divided by total gallons sold) is not calculated identically by all companies, this presentation may not be comparable to EBITDA per gallon presentations disclosed by other companies. Management believes that EBITDA per gallon is useful in evaluating Diamond Green Diesel's operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA per gallon generally eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and certain non-cash and other items presented on a per gallon basis that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations include: existing and unknown future limitations on the ability of the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries to make their cash flow available to the Company for payments on the Company's indebtedness or other purposes; reduced demands or prices for biofuels, biogases or renewable electricity; global demands for grain and oilseed commodities, which have exhibited volatility, and can impact the cost of feed for cattle, hogs and poultry, thus affecting available rendering feedstock and selling prices for the Company’s products; reductions in raw material volumes available to the Company due to weak margins in the meat production industry as a result of higher feed costs, reduced consumer demand, reduced volume due to government regulations affecting animal production or other factors, reduced volume from food service establishments, or otherwise; reduced demand for animal feed; reduced finished product prices, including a decline in fat, used cooking oil, protein or collagen (including, without limitation, collagen peptides and gelatin) finished product prices; changes to government policies around the world relating to renewable fuels and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions that adversely affect prices, margins or markets (including for the DGD Joint Venture), including programs like renewable fuel standards, low carbon fuel standards (“LCFS”), renewable fuel mandates and tax credits for biofuels, or loss or diminishment of tax credits due to failure to satisfy any eligibility requirements, including, without limitation, in relation to the blender tax credit or the Clean Fuels Production Credit (“CFPC”); climate related adverse results, including with respect to the Company’s climate goals, targets or commitments; possible product recall resulting from developments relating to the discovery of unauthorized adulterations to food or food additives or products which do not meet specifications, contract requirements or regulatory standards; the occurrence of 2009 H1N1 flu (initially known as “Swine Flu”), highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza (collectively known as “Bird Flu”), severe acute respiratory syndrome (“SARS”), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (or “BSE”), porcine epidemic diarrhea (“PED”) or other diseases associated with animal origin in the U.S. or elsewhere, such as the outbreak of African Swine Fever in China and elsewhere; the occurrence of pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 outbreak; unanticipated costs and/or reductions in raw material volumes related to the Company’s compliance with the existing or unforeseen new U.S. or foreign (including, without limitation, China) regulations (including new or modified animal feed, Bird Flu, SARS, PED, BSE or ASF or similar or unanticipated regulations) affecting the industries in which the Company operates or its value added products; risks associated with the DGD Joint Venture, including possible unanticipated operating disruptions, a decline in margins on the products produced by the DGD Joint Venture and issues relating to the announced SAF upgrade project (including, without limitation, operational, mechanical, product quality, market based or other such issues); risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protections by foreign countries; tax changes, such as global minimum tax measures, or issues related to administration, guidance and/or regulations associated with biofuel policies, including CFPC, and risks associated with the qualification and sale of such credits; difficulties or a significant disruption (including, without limitation, due to cyber-attack) in the Company’s information systems, networks or the confidentiality, availability or integrity of our data or failure to implement new systems and software successfully; risks relating to possible third-party claims of intellectual property infringement; increased contributions to the Company’s pension and benefit plans, including multiemployer and employer-sponsored defined benefit pension plans as required by legislation, regulation or other applicable U.S. or foreign law or resulting from a U.S. mass withdrawal event; bad debt write-offs; loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations; continued or escalated conflict in the Middle East, North Korea, Ukraine or elsewhere, including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and other associated or emerging conflicts in the Middle East; uncertainty regarding the exit of the U.K. from the European Union; uncertainty regarding any administration changes in the U.S. or elsewhere around the world, including, without limitation, impacts to trade, tariffs and/or policies impacting the Company (such as biofuel policies and mandates); and/or unfavorable export or import markets. These factors, coupled with volatile prices for natural gas and diesel fuel, inflation rates, climate conditions, currency exchange fluctuations, general performance of the U.S. and global economies, disturbances in world financial, credit, commodities and stock markets, and any decline in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, including the inability of consumers and companies to obtain credit due to lack of liquidity in the financial markets, among others, could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking statements included in this report or negatively impact the Company’s results of operations. Among other things, future profitability may be affected by the Company’s ability to grow its business, which faces competition from companies that may have substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company’s announced share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and purchases of shares under the program are subject to market conditions and other factors, which are likely to change from time to time. For more detailed discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties regarding the Company, its business and the industries in which it operates, see the Company’s filings with the SEC, including the Risk Factors discussion in Item 1A of Part I of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. The Company cautions readers that all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in circumstances, new events or otherwise.

Canada Goose Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206755048/en/Canada-Goose-Reports-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2025-Results,2025-02-06 12:15:00," TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (NYSE, TSX: GOOS) announced today financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended December 29, 2024. All amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated.   “Our third quarter results highlight the power of strong execution during a key consumer shopping period, particularly in December where we saw significant acceleration in the business,"" said Dani Reiss, Chairman and CEO of Canada Goose. “Brand momentum was robust in the quarter, amplified by the integrated global launch of our new Snow Goose collection which drove record-setting media coverage and a three-year high in brand search. Our retail execution delivered solid results despite ongoing macro challenges and, looking ahead, our focus remains on balancing operational excellence with strategic investments and strengthening the foundations that will continue driving both brand heat and commercial momentum across all our channels.”   Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Business Highlights:  Notable highlights from our third quarter included the following:    Launched Haider Ackermann’s inaugural capsule, reintroducing our Snow Goose label through a fulsome 360° campaign. The campaign included impactful in-store activations, influencer collaborations, social media campaigns, and brand events in locations including Iceland, Seoul, and Toronto.    As part of our brand evolution, elevated the wholesale shopping experience at Selfridges, London with a bold visual expression, launching a Polar Bears International pop-up and taking over the window displays with our Fall Winter 24 collection.    Opened two concession-based shop-in-shops bringing the total permanent store count to 74 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025, strengthening our position in key markets.    Subsequent to Third Quarter Fiscal 2025   Launched our Eyewear collection through our licensee partnership with Marchon Eyewear, representing a significant milestone in our ongoing product expansion journey.    Appointed Judit Bankus as our new Head of Merchandising.    Third Quarter Financial Highlights1: All Year-Over-Year Comparisons Unless Otherwise Noted:   Total revenue decreased $2.0m to $607.9m, down 2.2% on a constant currency basis2.   DTC revenue increased 0.7% to $517.8m, or down 1.4% on a constant currency basis2 with DTC comparable sales3 declining 6.2%, partially offset by sales from non-comparable stores.    Wholesale revenue decreased 7.5% to $75.7m or 8.1% on a constant currency basis2 due to a planned lower order book as we continue to elevate our presence within this sales channel by right-sizing our inventory position and building strong relationships with brand-aligned partners.    Other revenue increased $0.3m to $14.4m.      Gross profit increased 0.5% to $452.0m. Gross margin for the quarter was 74.4% compared to 73.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to pricing and lower inventory provisioning, partially offset by product mix.    Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $247.7m, compared to $250.9m in the prior year period. The reduction in SG&A was primarily due to corporate expense efficiencies, including our fiscal 2024 workforce reductions, as well non-recurrence of costs relating to the Transformation Program and foreign exchange fluctuations. This was partially offset by a planned increase in marketing spend associated with the Snow Goose campaign and increase in store expenses such as labor related to the expansion of our global retail network.    Operating Income was $204.3m, compared to $198.8m in the prior year period.    Adjusted EBIT4 was $205.2m, compared to $207.2m in the prior year period.    Net income attributable to shareholders was $139.7m, or $1.42 per diluted share, compared with a net income attributable to shareholders of $130.6m, or $1.29 per diluted share in the prior year period.    Adjusted net income attributable to shareholders4 was $148.3m, or $1.51 per diluted share, compared with an adjusted net income attributed to shareholders of $138.6m, or $1.37 per diluted share in the prior year period.    Balance Sheet Highlights  Inventory of $407.4m for the third quarter ended December 29, 2024, was down 15% year-over-year, due to a temporary reduction in production levels.   The Company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2025 with net debt4 of $546.4m, compared with $587.4m at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 due to higher cash balances primarily driven by working capital release this fiscal year. The Company renewed its normal course issuer bid (the “NCIB”) in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, allowing the company to purchase for cancellation up to 4,556,841 subordinate voting shares over the 12-month period commencing on November 22, 2024 and ending on November 21, 2025, representing 10% of the “public float” determined in accordance with the requirements of the Toronto Stock Exchange as at November 8, 2024.

includes references to certain non-IFRS financial measures such as adjusted EBIT, adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of the Company, net debt, and constant currency revenue and certain non-IFRS ratios such as, adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted net income (loss) per basic and diluted share attributable to the shareholders of the Company. These financial measures are employed by the Company to measure its operating and economic performance and to assist in business decision-making, as well as providing key performance information to senior management. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the Company’s operating and financial performance. These financial measures are not defined under IFRS nor do they replace or supersede any standardized measure under IFRS. Other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Additional information, including definitions and reconciliations of non-IFRS financial measures to the nearest IFRS financial measure can be found in our MD&A for the third quarter and three quarters ended December 29, 2024, under “Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Other Specified Financial Measures”. Such reconciliations can also be found in this press release under “Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures” below.   This press release also includes references to DTC comparable sales (decline) growth which is a supplementary financial measure defined as a rate of (decline) growth of sales on a constant currency basis from e-Commerce sites and stores which have been operating for one full year (12 successive fiscal months). The measure excludes store sales from both periods for the specific trading days when the stores were closed, whether those closures occurred in the current period or the comparative period.   Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures  The tables below reconcile net income to adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income attributable to shareholders of the Company for the periods indicated, constant currency revenue to revenue across segments and geographies, and net debt for purposes of presenting its calculation. Adjusted EBIT margin is equal to adjusted EBIT for the period presented as a percentage of revenue for the same period.           Third quarter ended          Three quarters ended      CAD $ millions    December 29,  2024          December 31,  2023          December 29,  2024          December 31,  2023      Net income    143.6                 131.4                 75.9                 50.5             Add (deduct) the impact of:                                                Income tax expense     46.4                 52.6                 7.1                 8.0             Net interest, finance and other costs     14.3                 14.8                 26.0                 42.9             Operating income    204.3                 198.8                 109.0                 101.4             Head office transition costs (a)     —                 —                 —                 0.8             Japan Joint Venture costs (c)     —                 2.3                 —                 2.4             Transformation Program costs (e)     —                 5.6                 —                 26.6             Paola Confectii Earn-Out costs (f)     0.9                 0.5                 2.7                 0.5             Total adjustments     0.9                 8.4                 2.7                 30.3             Adjusted EBIT    205.2                 207.2                 111.7                 131.7             Adjusted EBIT margin    33.8    %          34.0    %          11.6    %          13.5    %             Third quarter ended           Three quarters ended       CAD $ millions    December 29,  2024           December 31,  2023           December 29,  2024           December 31,  2023       Net income          143.6                       131.4                       75.9                       50.5             Add (deduct) the impact of:                                                    Head office transition costs (a) (b)           —                       —                       —                       1.2             Japan Joint Venture costs (c)           —                       2.3                       —                       2.4             Japan Joint Venture remeasurement (gain) loss on contingent consideration and put option (d)           (0.6     )                 3.0                       (11.5     )                 10.8             Transformation Program costs (e)           —                       5.6                       —                       26.6             Paola Confectii Earn-Out costs (f)           0.9                       0.5                       2.7                       0.5             Unrealized foreign exchange loss on Term Loan (g)           4.9                       0.5                       5.7                       —                         5.2                       11.9                       (3.1     )                 41.5             Tax effect of adjustments           (0.8     )                 (1.3     )                 (1.2     )                 (6.2     )       Deferred tax adjustment (h)           —                       —                       —                       (0.5     )       Adjusted net income          148.0                       142.0                       71.6                       85.3             Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest (i)           0.3                       (3.4     )                 5.8                       (3.6     )       Adjusted net income attributable to shareholders of the Company          148.3                       138.6                       77.4                       81.7                                                                   Weighted average number of shares outstanding                                                    Basic           96,798,985                       100,253,473                       96,714,942                       102,144,232             Diluted           98,172,212                       101,308,836                       98,033,979                       103,125,365             Adjusted net income per basic share attributable to shareholders of the Company    $     1.53                 $     1.38                 $     0.80                 $     0.80             Adjusted net income per diluted share attributable to shareholders of the Company    $     1.51                 $     1.37                 $     0.79                 $     0.79              (a)      Costs incurred for the corporate head office transition, including depreciation on right-of-use assets.

See “Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Other Specified Financial Measures” for a description of this measure.       4 Adjusted EBIT, adjusted net income attributable to shareholders of the Company, and net debt are non-IFRS financial measures, and Adjusted EBIT margin, and adjusted net income per diluted share attributable to the shareholders of the Company are non-IFRS financial ratios. See “Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Other Specified Financial Measures” for more information.       5 The Company is not able to provide, without unreasonable effort, a reconciliation of the guidance for non-IFRS adjusted EBIT and non-IFRS adjusted net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable IFRS measure because the Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments included in the most directly comparable IFRS measure that would be necessary for such reconciliations, including (a) income tax related accruals in respect of certain one-time items (b) the impact of foreign currency exchange and (c) non-recurring expenses that cannot reasonably be estimated in advance. These adjustments are inherently variable and uncertain and depend on various factors that are beyond the Company's control and as a result it is also unable to predict their probable significance. Therefore, because management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported results in accordance with IFRS, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of the non-IFRS measures included in our fiscal 2025 guidance.         "

Advanced Drainage Systems Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206524020/en/Advanced-Drainage-Systems-Announces-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2025-Results,2025-02-06 12:10:00," HILLIARD, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. (NYSE: WMS) (“ADS” or the “Company”), a leading provider of innovative water management solutions in the stormwater and onsite septic wastewater industries today announced financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2024.   Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results   Net sales increased $28.2 million or 4.3% to $690.5 million   Net income decreased $24.6 million or 23.0% to $82.3 million   Net income per diluted share decreased $0.30 or 22.3% to $1.04   Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) decreased $12.7 million or 6.2% to $191.5 million   Adjusted Earnings per share (Non-GAAP) decreased $0.28 or 20.3% to $1.09   Year-to-Date Fiscal 2025 Results   Net sales increased $67.9 million or 3.1% to $2.3 billion   Net income decreased $42.0 million or 10.1% to $375.8 million   Net income per diluted share decreased $0.47 or 9.0% to $4.77   Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) decreased $19.2 million or 2.6% to $712.5 million   Adjusted Earnings per share (Non-GAAP) decreased $0.31 or 6.0% to $4.86   Scott Barbour, President and Chief Executive Officer of ADS commented, ""The fiscal third quarter financial results were in line with expectations. The ADS business progressed on plan while the Infiltrator business modestly outperformed driven by double digit growth in both tanks and advanced treatment products. The construction market demand, pricing environment, material cost and operating performance played out like we thought they would going into the quarter.""   ""Reflecting on the 2024 hurricane season that concluded in November, it is clear that storm events are growing in their intensity and frequency. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly evident that much of the current stormwater infrastructure has not kept pace with this change, leaving many communities in a challenging position. In fact, a recent survey conducted by ADS and The Harris Poll showed 60% of Americans are concerned with stormwater infrastructure in their communities, up nearly 10% compared to the prior year. Additionally, 64% of Americans reported stormwater having a negative impact on their communities. ADS' solutions are uniquely positioned to address concerns around stormwater management, including flood mitigation and minimizing property damage, while continuing to support the development of more resilient communities.""   ""With the growing demand for water management solutions, we continue to add products and capacity to ensure we grow our leadership position in both stormwater and decentralized wastewater. In the third quarter, we closed the acquisition of Orenco, expanding our offering in a highly fragmented and fast-growing segment of advanced treatment in decentralized wastewater. We recently broke ground on an ADS Recycling facility expansion in Cordele, GA to increase capacity in the Southeast, and we will continue investing capital to support growth in markets like the Southeast where material conversion opportunities remain.""   ""As we move into the final quarter of this fiscal year, we are focused on executing our sales strategies and driving increased productivity. We will continue to deliver exceptional service to our customers and pursue profitable growth through attractive products, markets and partnerships, while at the same time investing capital and resources across our business to drive sustainable growth and profitability longer term.""   Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results  Net sales increased $28.2 million, or 4.3%, to $690.5 million, as compared to $662.4 million in the prior year quarter. Domestic pipe sales decreased $5.7 million, or 1.6%, to $343.4 million. Domestic allied products & other sales increased $5.0 million, or 3.2%, to $161.5 million. Infiltrator sales increased $31.4 million, or 30.3%, to $135.3 million. Excluding the acquisition of Orenco Systems, Inc. (""Orenco""), Infiltrator organic revenue increased 5.8%. The overall increase in domestic net sales was primarily driven by demand in the construction end markets. International sales decreased $2.6 million, or 4.9%, to $50.4 million.   Gross profit decreased $18.3 million, or 7.0%, to $241.6 million as compared to $259.8 million in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit is primarily driven by unfavorable pricing and material cost as well as the mix impact from the inclusion of Orenco. This unfavorability was partially offset by favorable volume and mix of construction market and Infiltrator sales.   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $9.5 million, or 10.4% to $100.8 million, as compared to $91.3 million. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expense was 14.6% as compared to 13.8% in the prior year, primarily driven by the acquisition of Orenco.   Net income per diluted share decreased $0.30, or 22.3%, to $1.04, as compared to $1.34 per share in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the factors mentioned above.   Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) decreased $12.7 million, or 6.2%, to $191.5 million, as compared to $204.2 million in the prior year, primarily due to the factors mentioned above. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 27.7% as compared to 30.8% in the prior year.   Segment sales results are based on Net sales to external customers. Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures for Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Earnings per Share have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”   Year-to-Date Fiscal 2025 Results  Net sales increased $67.9 million, or 3.1%, to $2,288.5 million, as compared to $2,220.6 million in the prior year.

The overall increase in domestic net sales was primarily driven by demand in the construction end markets. International sales decreased $6.7 million, or 3.9%, to $164.6 million.   Gross profit decreased $26.0 million, or 2.9%, to $868.0 million as compared to $894.0 million in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit is primarily driven by unfavorable pricing and material cost, partially offset by favorable volume, mix and manufacturing costs.   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $19.4 million, or 7.2% to $289.0 million, as compared to $269.5 million. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expense was 12.6% as compared to 12.1% in the prior year.   Net income per diluted share decreased $0.47, or 9.0%, to $4.77, as compared to $5.24 per share in the prior year. Results for fiscal 2024 include a $14.9 million gain on the sale of assets, which after considering the income tax impact of this gain impacted net income per diluted share by $0.13.   Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) decreased $19.2 million, or 2.6%, to $712.5 million, as compared to $731.8 million in the prior year, primarily due to the factors mentioned above. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA was 31.1% as compared to 33.0% in the prior year.   Balance Sheet and Liquidity  Net cash provided by operating activities was $540.3 million, as compared to $700.3 million in the prior year. Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) was $373.9 million, as compared to $563.9 million in the prior year. Net debt (total debt and finance lease obligations net of cash) was $920.8 million as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $59.9 million from March 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s trailing-twelve-month leverage ratio was 1.0 times Adjusted EBITDA.   In the nine months ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 0.4 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $69.9 million.

ADS management uses non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results available in the accompanying tables.   Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  This press release includes references to Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Earnings per Share, non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are not intended to be substitutes for those reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.   EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that comprise net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, non-cash charges and certain other expenses. The Company’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by management and the Company’s board of directors to assess financial performance and evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s business strategies. Accordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as the Company’s management and board of directors. In order to provide investors with a meaningful reconciliation, the Company has provided a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income.   Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that comprises cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow is a measure used by management and the Company’s board of directors to assess the Company’s ability to generate cash. Accordingly, management believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. In order to provide investors with a meaningful reconciliation, the Company has provided a reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities to Free Cash Flow.   Adjusted Earnings per Share excludes (gains) losses on disposals of assets or business, restructuring expenses, impairment charges and transaction costs.

Broken String Biosciences Launches Catalyst Program to Shorten Gene Editing Therapy Development by Months,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206861556/en/Broken-String-Biosciences-Launches-Catalyst-Program-to-Shorten-Gene-Editing-Therapy-Development-by-Months,2025-02-06 12:08:00," BOSTON & CAMBRIDGE, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Broken String Biosciences (“Broken String”), a leader in advancing gene editing safety, today opened its Catalyst Early Access Program (EAP) for developers of gene-edited therapies that allow for the detection of on- and off-target edits at high resolution, in days, in their own labs. The program allows select companies to use Broken String’s INDUCE-seq® platform as a first-of-its-kind offering for rapidly detecting on-target and off-target effects that can occur during gene editing. This new on-demand offering enables gene editing therapy developers to assess on- and off-target effects in days, as opposed to months.   The offering can be integrated into early therapeutics development at target validation, reducing risk and removing the need for costly internal workflows that slow development progress. It is cell and nuclease agnostic, enabling direct measurement in clinically relevant samples, addressing regulatory scrutiny around unintended edits.   Felix Dobbs, Ph.D., co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Broken String said: “The gene editing industry has reached an inflection point, where the momentum required to reach its potential can only be sustained by expanding patient access — which requires standardization, faster drug development, and robust safety characterization. Our Catalyst program will enable faster and broader industry-wide adoption of INDUCE-seq® and position this as an essential technology for the next wave of gene-editing based therapeutics.”   For years, companies have been using INDUCE-seq® via Broken String’s labs to ensure safety before entering clinical trials. INDUCE-seq® solves a fundamental safety challenge that dates back to the origins of gene editing: how to assess on- and off-target effects as they happen. By making the same technology available for developers in their own labs, they retain full control over their experiments while incorporating safety throughout the entire development process.   The industry lacks a gold standard for detecting on- and off-target edits. Current approaches can have PCR-induced bias, and miss low-frequency unintended edits that are potentially dangerous and can have disastrous consequences for clinical programs. INDUCE-seq® improves on existing technologies by delivering unbiased genome-wide insights, accurately detecting double-strand DNA breaks from CRISPR and other gene editing technologies.   Broken String’s on-premise Catalyst EAP accelerates discovery programs with iterative use to screen guide RNAs based on efficacy, as measured through on-target editing efficiency, as well as also providing quick indications for off-target safety. Enrollment in the Catalyst EAP is limited to a select group of participants. Interested companies can visit https://www.brokenstringbio.com/resources/catalyst-program/ to learn more and apply.   About Broken String Biosciences  Broken String Biosciences is advancing more precise, safe, and effective cell and gene therapies through its cutting-edge technology platforms.   The company’s core platform, INDUCE-seq®, was developed as the new gold standard for precise mapping of DNA breaks to measure and quantify on- and off-target genetic edits, crucial for ensuring the efficacy and safety of advanced therapies from discovery through commercialization.   Broken String Biosciences was spun out of Cardiff University by genomics experts. The company is venture-funded and has raised $20 million to date. To learn more about the company, visit www.brokenstringbio.com.   About INDUCE-seq®  Broken String Bioscience’s INDUCE-seq® enables direct, cell-based measurements of on-target and off-target edits directly from a clinically relevant biological system. This ensures therapy developers can characterize safety and efficacy as early as discovery, before committing substantial budgets and time to preclinical or clinical trials.   The technology also allows for off-target assessments tailored to a patient’s specific genotype, enabling developers to bring safety evaluations closer to the patient. This capability supports faster, more targeted treatments, helping to accelerate progress in life-saving therapies.   Through Broken String’s Early Access Program, select partners with gene editing therapies in development can experience many of INDUCE-seq®’s advantages over existing approaches, offering:    Accurate and Rapid Safety Data – By providing actionable insights in approximately two days, the program allows therapy developers to iterate on guide RNA designs, optimize delivery systems, and identify unintended edits. It is cell and nuclease agnostic, enabling direct measurement in clinically relevant samples, addressing regulatory scrutiny around unintended edits.     This Rapid Turnaround can save months of development time and help avoid costly late-stage failures.     Comprehensive Cell-Specific Analysis – The program supports off-target detection in diverse cell and tissue types, where unintended edits might compromise the safety or efficacy of therapies. For instance, therapies targeting rare liver diseases or neurological conditions can be tested for unintended effects on nearby tissues, an increasingly important requirement for regulatory approval.     Iterative Experimentation for Complex Disorders – Participants can conduct repeated assessments, allowing for real-time refinement of editing strategies. This is especially valuable as gene editing expands to treat complex, multi-gene disorders, where multiple targets and delivery mechanisms must be carefully balanced to minimize risks.     Regulatory Alignment for Streamlined Approvals – With regulators placing greater scrutiny on off-target risks, Broken String’s technology helps developers create comprehensive safety profiles that demonstrate the reliability of their edits. This proactive approach improves alignment with regulatory expectations, reducing delays and bolstering confidence among investors and stakeholders.   "

Net sales also increased due to an extended fall season and accelerated pre-season sales in H&G and strong e-commerce sales in HPC partially offset by a sales decline in GPC primarily due to a strategic acceleration of orders into the prior year related to the S/4Hana ERP implementation.    Gross profit and margin increased from higher sales, cost improvement actions and favorable foreign currency partially offset by ocean freight inflation and higher tariffs due to the expiration of tariff exemptions for certain product lines.    Operating income increased due to improved gross profit and cost savings initiatives offset by higher marketing and advertising spend.    Net income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share increased from the increase in operating income, lower interest costs, and lower share count partially offset by lower investment income.    Adjusted EBITDA decreased 7.7% and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 110 basis points attributable to lower investment income and increased brand-building investments partially offset by increased gross profit.    Adjusted diluted EPS increased to $1.02 due to lower interest expense and a reduction in outstanding shares partially offset by lower adjusted EBITDA.

North American sales were impacted by the pullforward of approximately $10 million of sales from the quarter into Q4 FY24 in advance of the S/4Hana ERP implementation. EMEA Companion Animal sales increased mid-single digits from the continued expansion of the Good Boy brand throughout Europe and strong demand in Dog and Cat Food. Category softness in global Aquatics negatively impacted sales in each region.   Adjusted EBITDA decreased due to lower sales volume, inflation, and increased brand-focused investments, offset by cost improvements and other favorable variances.

Net sales were also impacted by the pullforward of sales into the quarter due to H&G's Q2 go-live on S/4Hana. Sales increased in all categories other than Cleaning.   Adjusted EBITDA increased due to higher sales volume, cost improvements and favorable trade variances, offset by inflation and increased brand-focused investments in the period.

Excluding unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $5.9 million, organic net sales increased 3.1%. Organic sales growth in Personal Care was offset by declines in Home Appliances. Growth in e-commerce sales outpaced traditional retail sales growth globally. Personal Care sales grew in each region, while Home Appliance sales growth in EMEA was offset by declines in North America and other regions.   Adjusted EBITDA was flat to last year, with higher sales volumes and the benefit of cost improvements offset by inflation, higher tariffs from the expiration of exclusions on certain product lines, and increased brand focused investments.   Liquidity and Debt  As of the end of the quarter, the Company had a cash balance of $180 million and total liquidity of $670.7 million, including undrawn capacity on its cash flow revolver of $490.8 million. The Company also had $575.1 million of debt outstanding, consisting of $496.1 million of senior unsecured notes and $79.0 million of finance leases, and ended the quarter with net debt of approximately $395.2 million.   Fiscal 2025 Earnings Framework  Spectrum Brands continues to expect low single-digit growth in reported net sales in fiscal 2025. Fiscal 2025 adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase by mid to high single-digits. Adjusted free cash flow is expected to be approximately 50% of adjusted EBITDA.   The Company continues to target a long-term net leverage ratio of 2.0 - 2.5 times.   Conference Call/Webcast Scheduled for 9:00 A.M.

Spectrum Brands – A Home Essentials Company™  Non-GAAP Measurements  Our consolidated results contain non-GAAP metrics such as organic net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted EPS and adjusted Free Cash Flow. While we believe organic net sales and adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted EPS and adjusted Free Cash Flow are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our financial results in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.  Organic Net Sales - We define organic net sales as net sales excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and/or impact from acquisitions (where applicable). We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We use organic net sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and segment performance. Organic growth is calculated by comparing organic net sales to net sales in the prior year. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates is determined by translating the current period net sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior comparative period. Net sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. We exclude net sales from acquired businesses in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period.  Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA Margin - adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP metrics used by management, which we believe are useful to investors to measure the operational strength and performance of our business. These metrics provide investors additional information about our operating profitability for certain non-cash items, non-routine items we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items not core to our continuing operations. By providing these measures, together with a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives, as securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities, and they are regularly used by management and our board of directors for internal purposes in evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against other peer companies using similar measures. They facilitate comparisons between peer companies since interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA is also used for determining compliance with the Company’s debt covenants. EBITDA is calculated by excluding the Company’s income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense (from intangible assets) from net income. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain non-cash adjustments including share based compensation; impairment charges on property, plant and equipment, operating and finance lease assets, and goodwill and other intangible assets; gain or loss from the early extinguishment of debt through the repurchase or early redemption of outstanding debt; and purchase accounting adjustments recognized in income subsequent to an acquisition attributable to the step value on assets acquired, including, but not limited to, inventory or operating lease assets. Additionally, the Company will further recognize adjustments from adjusted EBITDA for other costs, gains and losses that are considered significant, non-recurring, or otherwise not supporting the continuing operations and revenue generating activity of the segment or Company, including but not limited to, exit and disposal activities, or incremental costs associated with strategic transactions, restructuring and optimization initiatives such as the acquisition or divestiture of a business, related integration or separation costs, or the development and implementation of strategies to optimize or restructure the Company and its operations. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of reported net sales.  Adjusted EPS - Management uses adjusted EPS as one means of analyzing the Company’s current and future financial performance and identifying trends in its financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that adjusted EPS is a useful measure for providing further insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. By providing these measures, together with a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives, as securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of financial performance, and they are regularly used by management and our board of directors for internal purposes in evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against other peer companies using similar measures. Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding the effect of certain adjustments from diluted EPS, including non-cash adjustments including impairment charges on property, plant and equipment, operating and finance lease assets, and goodwill and other intangible assets; gain or loss from the early extinguishment of debt through the repurchase or early redemption of outstanding debt; and purchase accounting adjustments recognized in income subsequent to an acquisition attributable to the step value on assets acquired, including, but not limited to, inventory or operating lease assets. Additionally, the Company will further recognize adjustments from diluted EPS for other costs, gains and losses that are considered significant, non-recurring, or otherwise not supporting the continuing operations and revenue generating activity of the segment or Company, including but not limited to, exit and disposal activities, or incremental costs associated with strategic transactions, restructuring and optimization initiatives such as the acquisition or divestiture of a business, related integration or separation costs, or the development and implementation of strategies to optimize or restructure the Company and its operations. Adjusted EPS is further impacted by the effect on the income tax provision from adjustments made to reported diluted EPS.  Adjusted Free Cash Flow - Management uses adjusted free cash flow as a means of analyzing the Company's operating results and evaluating cash flow generation from its revenue generating activities, excluding certain cash flow activity associated with strategic transactions and other costs and receipts attributable to non-recurring events. Management believes that adjusted free cash flow is a useful measure in understanding cash flow conversion associated with the Company's operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt, dividends and share repurchases and meetings its working capital requirements. By providing these measures, together with a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are generating cash flow from operations, as securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of financial performance, and they are regularly used by management and our board of directors for internal purposes in evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against other peer companies using similar measures. Free cash flow is calculated by excluding capital expenditures from cash flow provided (used) by operating activities and further adjusted for non-operating strategic transaction costs and other non-recurring or unusual cash flow activity that would otherwise be considered operating cash flow under US GAAP. Cash flow conversion is adjusted Free Cash Flow as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA.  The Company provides this information to investors to assist in comparisons of past, present and future operating results and to assist in highlighting the results of on-going operations. While the Company’s management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace the Company’s GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results. Other Supplemental Information has been provided to demonstrate reconciliation of non-GAAP measurements discussed above to most relevant GAAP financial measurements.

Omnicell Announces Fiscal Year and Fourth Quarter 2024 Results,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206336508/en/Omnicell-Announces-Fiscal-Year-and-Fourth-Quarter-2024-Results,2025-02-06 12:00:00," FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL) (“Omnicell,” “we,” “our,” “us,” “management,” or the “Company”), a leader in transforming the pharmacy and nursing care delivery model, today announced results for its fiscal year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024.     “We delivered solid financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024, including returning to year-over-year revenue growth. We are pleased with the improved execution of the business throughout 2024, including strong free cash flows achieved in the year,” stated Randall Lipps, chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder of Omnicell. “As we progress through 2025, we remain focused on successfully executing on our strategic priorities, which include driving long-term revenue growth, achieving consistent GAAP profitability, and continuing to raise the bar in medication management and adherence through innovation and bringing new products and services to market.”   Financial Results  Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $307 million, up $48 million, or 19%, from the fourth quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter increase in total revenues reflects the improvement of the macroeconomic environment and the timing of implementation of XT Series systems, as well as continued growth in our SaaS and Expert Services (formerly known as Advanced Services), including an increase in revenues from our Specialty Pharmacy Services offering. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $1.112 billion, down $35 million, or 3%, from the year ended December 31, 2023. The year-over-year decrease in total revenues reflects the impact of a challenging environment through a significant portion of 2024 for some of our health system customers and the timing of our XT Series systems lifecycle, as we are largely through the replacement cycle.   Total GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $16 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net loss of $14 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. Total GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $13 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net loss of $20 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.   Total non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $28 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $15 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. Total non-GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $79 million, or $1.71 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $87 million, or $1.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.   Total non-GAAP EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $46 million. This compares to non-GAAP EBITDA of $24 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Total non-GAAP EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $136 million. This compares to non-GAAP EBITDA of $138 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.   Bookings and Backlog - Historical Metric  Total bookings(1) for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $923 million compared to $854 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, or an increase of 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by XT Series upgrades as we complete the XT Series upgrade cycle, as well as better than expected bookings of XTExtend, a core component of the multi-year XT Amplify innovation program.   The chart below summarizes our total backlog(2) under the definition of bookings in use for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:            December 31,             2024          2023             (In thousands)      Total backlog     $     1,201,296                 $     1,142,686             By type:                         Product backlog      $     646,508                 $     610,832             SaaS and Expert Services backlog (3)     $     554,788                 $     531,854             By duration and type:                         Short-term product backlog      $     447,412                 $     377,936             Long-term product backlog      $     199,096                 $     232,896             Short-term SaaS and Expert Services backlog (3)     $     93,113                 $     72,455             Long-term SaaS and Expert Services backlog (3)     $     461,675                 $     459,399                                        ____________________________    (1)     We utilize bookings as an indicator of the success of our business. During 2024, we defined bookings generally as: (i) the value of non-cancelable contracts for our connected devices, software products, and SaaS and Expert Services (although, for those SaaS and Expert Services contracts without a minimum commitment, bookings only include the amount of revenue that has been recognized once the services have been provided); and (ii) for our consumables, the value of orders placed through our Omnicell Storefront online platform or through written or telephonic orders. We typically exclude technical services and other less significant items ancillary to our products and services, such as freight revenue, from bookings. In addition, dependent upon counterparty or credit risk, which is evaluated at the time of contract signing, for a given multi-year subscription contract we may reduce the portion of the contractual commitment booked at a given time. Connected devices and software license bookings are recorded as revenue upon customer acceptance of the installation or receipt of goods. Revenues from SaaS and Expert Services bookings are recorded over the contractual term.       (2)     Backlog is the dollar amount of bookings that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Bookings for those SaaS and Expert Services contracts without a minimum commitment are not included in backlog. In addition, dependent upon counterparty or credit risk, which is evaluated at the time of contract signing, for a given multi-year subscription contract we may reduce the portion of the contractual commitment booked at a given time, and these excluded amounts are not included in backlog. A majority of our connected devices and software license products are installable and recognized as revenues within twelve months of booking, while service revenues from SaaS and Expert Services are recorded over the contractual term. Larger or more complex implementations such as software-enabled connected devices for Central Pharmacy, including but not limited to our Central Pharmacy Dispensing Service and IV Compounding Service, are often installed and recognized as revenue between 12 and 24 months after booking. We consider backlog that is expected to be converted to revenues in more than twelve months to be long-term backlog. We believe a majority of long-term product backlog will be convertible into revenues in 12 to 24 months. Long-term SaaS and Expert Services backlog typically represents multi-year subscription agreements (usually with contractual terms of 2 to 7 years, some of which have not yet been implemented) that will be converted to revenue over the contractual term. Due to industry practice that allows customers to change order configurations with limited advance notice prior to shipment and as customer installation schedules may change, backlog as of any particular date may not necessarily indicate the timing of future revenue. However, we do believe that backlog is an indication of a customer’s willingness to install our solutions and revenue we expect to generate over time.       (3)     Includes only the value of SaaS and Expert Services non-cancelable contracts with minimum commitments.            Product Bookings, Product Backlog and Annual Recurring Revenue - New Metrics  Starting in 2025, we will utilize product bookings(1) as a key performance metric for our business. Under the new definition, product bookings as of December 31, 2024 were $558 million. In addition, going forward, we will no longer be reporting SaaS and Expert Services backlog information, as these revenue streams will be captured by the new Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) metric, which we will begin utilizing as a key performance metric for our business. For comparative purposes, the table below summarizes our product backlog and ARR for December 31, 2024 under the new definitions of product bookings and ARR:                 December 31,                  2024                                      (In thousands)      Total product backlog(2)          $     646,440             By duration:                   Short-term product backlog           $     447,344             Long-term product backlog                 199,096                                 Annual Recurring Revenue(3)          $     580,025             ____________________________    (1)     We define product bookings generally as the value of non-cancelable contracts for our connected devices and software licenses. We typically exclude freight revenue and other less significant items ancillary to our products from product bookings. In addition, dependent upon counterparty or credit risk, which is evaluated at the time of contract signing, for a given multi-year subscription contract we may reduce the value of the contractual commitment booked at a given time. Connected devices and software license bookings are recorded as revenue upon customer acceptance of the installation or receipt of goods. We utilize product bookings as an indicator of the success of certain portions of our business that generate non-recurring revenue.       (2)     Product backlog is the dollar amount of product bookings that have not yet been recognized as revenue. A majority of our connected devices and software license products are installable and recognized as revenues within twelve months of booking. Larger or more complex implementations such as software-enabled connected devices for Central Pharmacy, including, but not limited to, our Central Pharmacy Dispensing Service and IV Compounding Service, are often installed and recognized as revenue between 12 and 24 months after booking. Due to industry practice that allows customers to change order configurations with limited advance notice prior to shipment and as customer installation schedules may change, backlog as of any particular date may not necessarily indicate the timing of future revenue. However, we do believe that backlog is an indication of a customer’s willingness to install our solutions and revenue we expect to generate over time. We consider backlog that is expected to be converted to revenues in more than twelve months to be long-term backlog. We believe a majority of long-term product backlog will be convertible into revenues in 12-24 months.       (3)     We consider revenues generated from our consumables, technical services, and SaaS and Expert Services to be recurring revenues. For the portions of our business which generate recurring revenues, we utilize ARR as a key metric to measure our progress in growing our recurring revenue business. We define ARR at a measurement date as the revenue we expect to receive from our customers over the course of the following year for providing them with products or services. ARR includes expected revenue from all customers who are using our products or services at the reported date. For technical services and SaaS and Expert Services, solutions are generally on a contractual basis, typically with contracts for a period of 12 months or more, with a high probability of renewal. Probability of renewal is based on historic renewal experience of the individual revenue streams or management’s best estimates if historical renewal experience is not available. Consumables orders are placed by customers through our Omnicell Storefront online platform or through written or telephonic orders and are sold to a customer base who utilize the consumable product and place recurring orders when customer inventory is depleted. ARR is generally calculated based on revenues received in the most recent quarter and changes to expected revenues where solutions were added to or removed from the install or customer base in the quarter. Revenues from technical services and SaaS and Expert Services are recorded ratably over the service term. Revenue from consumables are recorded when the product has shipped and title has passed. Our measure of ARR may be different than that used by other companies. Because ARR is based on expected future revenue, it does not represent revenue recognized during a particular reporting period or revenue to be recognized in future reporting periods. ARR should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP revenues.            Balance Sheet  As of December 31, 2024, Omnicell’s balance sheet reflected cash and cash equivalents of $369 million, total debt (net of unamortized debt issuance costs) of $341 million, and total assets of $2.12 billion. Cash flows provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2024 totaled $56 million. This compares to cash flows provided by operating activities totaling $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.   As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $350 million of availability under its revolving credit facility with no outstanding balance.   Business Highlights  OmniSphere  The Company announced OmniSphere, a next-generation, cloud native, software workflow engine and data platform that is intended to seamlessly integrate enterprise-wide robotics and smart devices to support more secure, data-driven, medication management across the continuum of care. OmniSphere is designed to provide customers state-of-the-art security, improved productivity, enterprise-wide visibility, and streamlined upgrades, that is meant to deliver optimal end-to-end medication management.   ASHP Midyear  More than 1,600 pharmacy and industry leaders had the opportunity to explore Omnicell’s portfolio of outcomes-centric solutions and learn best practices from peers as part of the American Society of Health System Pharmacists (ASHP) Midyear 2024 Clinical Meeting and Exhibition. This annual event is the largest gathering of pharmacy professionals in the world.   HITRUST Data Security Certification  Omnicell’s medication management solutions powered by the OmniCenter platform once again received HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) certification, which we believe demonstrates the Company’s ongoing commitment to high standards for cybersecurity and data protection within the organization and for business partners and customers.   Omnicell Issues New Convertible Senior Notes  In late November, Omnicell issued $172.5 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2029. In addition, Omnicell completed a partial repurchase of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2025 for approximately $391.2 million in cash.   2025 Guidance  The table below summarizes Omnicell’s first quarter and full year 2025 guidance:            Q1 2025          2025      Product Bookings (2025 Definition)     Not provided           $500 million - $550 million       ARR     Not Provided           $610 million - $630 million       Total Revenues     $255 million - $265 million           $1.105 billion - $1.155 billion       Product Revenues     $137 million - $142 million           $610 million - $640 million       Service Revenues     $118 million - $123 million           $495 million - $515 million       Technical Services Revenues     Not provided           $235 million - $245 million       SaaS and Expert Service Revenue (formerly Advanced Services)     Not provided           $260 million - $270 million       Non-GAAP EBITDA     $19 million - $25 million           $140 million - $155 million       Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share     $0.15 - $0.25           $1.65 - $1.85      The Company does not provide guidance for GAAP net income or GAAP earnings per share, nor a reconciliation of any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. These forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures do not include certain items, which may be significant, including, but not limited to, unusual gains and losses, costs associated with future restructurings, acquisition-related expenses, and certain tax and litigation outcomes.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information  This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). Management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various performance measures. In addition to Omnicell’s GAAP results, we also consider non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP EBITDA margin, and non-GAAP free cash flow. These non-GAAP results and metrics should not be considered as an alternative to revenues, gross profit, operating expenses, income from operations, net income, net income per diluted share, diluted shares, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. We present these non-GAAP results and metrics because management considers them to be important supplemental measures of Omnicell’s performance and refers to such measures when analyzing Omnicell’s strategy and operations.   Our non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP EBITDA, and non-GAAP EBITDA margin are exclusive of certain items to facilitate management’s review of the comparability of Omnicell’s core operating results on a period-to-period basis because such items are not related to Omnicell’s ongoing core operating results as viewed by management. We define our “core operating results” as those revenues recorded in a particular period and the expenses incurred within such period that directly drive operating income in such period. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because, in addition to meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance, the measures give us a better understanding of how we believe we should invest in research and development, fund infrastructure growth, and evaluate the effectiveness of marketing strategies. In calculating the above non-GAAP results: non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin exclude from their GAAP equivalents items a), b), e), and g) below; non-GAAP operating expenses excludes from its GAAP equivalents items a), b), c), d), e), g), h), i), j) and k) below; non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP operating margin exclude from their GAAP equivalents items a), b), c), d), e), g), h),i), j) and k) below; and non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude from their GAAP equivalents items a) through l) below. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, as well as excluding certain other non-GAAP adjustments. Non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP EBITDA margin exclude from their GAAP equivalents items a), c), d), e), f), g), h), i), j), k) and l) below:     a)      Share-based compensation expense. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the expense related to equity-based compensation plans as it represents expenses that do not require cash settlement from Omnicell.                      b)      Amortization of acquired intangible assets. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the intangible assets amortization expense resulting from our past acquisitions. These non-cash charges are not considered by management to reflect the core cash-generating performance of the business and therefore are excluded from our non-GAAP results.                      c)      Acquisition-related expenses. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the expenses related to recent acquisitions, including amortization of representations and warranties insurance. These expenses are unrelated to our ongoing operations, vary in size and frequency, and are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to varying levels of acquisition activity. We believe that excluding these expenses provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.                      d)      Impairment and abandonment of operating lease right-of-use and other assets related to facilities. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the impairment and abandonment of certain operating lease right-of-use assets, as well as property and equipment, incurred in connection with restructuring activities for optimization of certain leased facilities. These non-cash charges are not considered by management to reflect the core cash-generating performance of the business and therefore are excluded from our non-GAAP results.                      e)      Severance-related expenses. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the expenses related to restructuring events, partially offset by reversals of previously recognized severance expenses in subsequent periods. These expenses are unrelated to our ongoing operations, vary in size and frequency, and are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to varying levels of restructuring activity. We believe that excluding these expenses provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.                      f)      Amortization of debt issuance costs. Debt issuance costs represent costs associated with the issuance of revolving credit facilities and convertible senior notes. The costs include underwriting fees, original issue discount, ticking fees, and legal fees. These non-cash expenses are not considered by management to reflect the core cash-generating performance of the business and therefore are excluded from our non-GAAP results.                      g)      RDS restructuring. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the nonrecurring restructuring charges related to the wind down of the Company’s Medimat Robotic Dispensing System (“RDS”) product line, partially offset by reversals of previously recognized expenses in subsequent periods. For the period ended December 31, 2024, those charges consisted primarily of inventory write-down, severance and other related expenses. These expenses are unrelated to our ongoing operations and we believe that excluding these expenses provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.                      h)      Executives transition costs. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the executives transition costs associated with the departure of certain executive officers, primarily consisting of severance expenses. These expenses are unrelated to our ongoing operations and we do not expect them to occur in the ordinary course of business. We believe that excluding these expenses provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.                      i)      Ransomware-related insurance recoveries. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the insurance recoveries related to the previously disclosed ransomware incident identified by the Company on May 4, 2022. These recoveries are unrelated to our ongoing operations and would not have otherwise been received by us in the normal course of business. We believe that excluding these recoveries provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.                      j)      Legal and regulatory expenses. We excluded from our non-GAAP results certain non-recurring legal and regulatory expenses, representing potential settlement amounts, related to certain claims of non-compliance with our government contracts that are outside of the ordinary course of our business. We believe that excluding these amounts provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.                      k)      Management severance costs. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the severance expense of certain senior management associated with the restructuring of our senior leadership team. We believe that excluding these expenses provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.                      l)      Gain on extinguishment of convertible senior notes, net. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the gain on the partial repurchase of the Company’s Senior Convertible Notes due 2025 as well as the related unwinding of the convertible note hedge and warrants. We believe that excluding this gain provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance, and to the financial results of peer companies.      Management adjusts for the above items because management believes that, in general, these items possess one or more of the following characteristics: their magnitude and timing is largely outside of Omnicell’s control; they are unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business in the ordinary course; they are unusual and we do not expect them to occur in the ordinary course of business; or they are non-operational or non-cash expenses involving stock compensation plans or other items.   We believe that the presentation of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP EBITDA, and non-GAAP EBITDA margin is warranted for several reasons:     a)      Such non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional analytical tool for understanding Omnicell’s financial performance by excluding the impact of items which may obscure trends in the core operating results of the business.                      b)      Since we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency and enhances investors’ ability to compare our performance across financial reporting periods.                      c)      These non-GAAP financial measures are employed by management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budget planning and forecasting.                      d)      These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to the operating results of other companies in our industry, which also use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results (although these companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than Omnicell does), thus enhancing the perspective of investors who wish to utilize such comparisons in their analysis of our performance.      Set forth below are additional reasons why share-based compensation expense is excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures:     i)      While share-based compensation calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718 constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense of Omnicell, it is not an expense that requires cash settlement by Omnicell. We therefore exclude these charges for purposes of evaluating core operating results. Thus, our non-GAAP measurements are presented exclusive of share-based compensation expense to assist management and investors in evaluating our core operating results.             ii)      We present ASC 718 share-based payment compensation expense in our reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures on a pre-tax basis because the exact tax differences related to the timing and deductibility of share-based compensation under ASC 718 are dependent upon the trading price of Omnicell’s common stock and the timing and exercise by employees of their stock options. As a result of these timing and market uncertainties, the tax effect related to share-based compensation expense would be inconsistent in amount and frequency and is therefore excluded from our non-GAAP results.      Non-GAAP diluted shares is defined as our GAAP diluted shares, excluding the impact of dilutive convertible senior notes for which the Company is economically hedged through its anti-dilutive convertible note hedge transaction. We believe non-GAAP diluted shares is a useful non-GAAP metric because it provides insight into the offsetting economic effect of the hedge transaction against potential conversion of the convertible senior notes.   Non-GAAP free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for software development for external use and purchases of property and equipment. We believe free cash flow is important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review and understanding of our overall financial, operational, and economic performance, because free cash flow takes into account certain capital expenditures and cash used for software development necessary to operate our business.   As stated above, we present non-GAAP financial measures because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of performance. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Omnicell’s GAAP results. In the future, we expect to incur expenses similar to certain of the non-GAAP adjustments described above and expect to continue reporting non-GAAP financial measures excluding such items. Some of the limitations in relying on non-GAAP financial measures are:     a)      Omnicell’s equity incentive plans and stock purchase plans are important components of incentive compensation arrangements and will be reflected as expenses in Omnicell’s GAAP results for the foreseeable future under ASC 718.             b)      Other companies, including companies in Omnicell’s industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than Omnicell, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.             c)      A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in Omnicell’s cash balance for the period.

Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:   “In 2024, we made significant strides in enhancing our client franchise, increasing client engagement with X-Pro, delivering progress with our high touch strategy, and achieving record levels of revenue and ADV across most product areas and regions.   We expect to build on this momentum in 2025 by focusing on key initiatives within three market channels. First, in the client-initiated channel, where we hold a clear leadership position, we launched our block trading solution in Eurobonds and emerging markets. We have seen early positive signs of success with a 22% increase in emerging markets block trading. Next, in the portfolio trading channel, in 2024, we gained over 200 basis points of U.S. high-grade market share and launched benchmark pricing for U.S. Credit and Eurobonds. Last, in the dealer-initiated channel, we expect to complete the integration of Dealer RFQ on X-Pro and the migration of Mid-X to Pragma technology in the second half of 2025.   We have clear visibility into the completion of these key initiatives and believe that executing our strategy across these three channels will drive market share growth throughout 2025 and long-term value for our shareholders.”   Table 1: 4Q24 select financial results   $ in millions, except per share data(unaudited) Revenues Operating Income Net Income Diluted EPS Net IncomeMargin (%) EBITDA1 EBITDA Margin(%)1    4Q24    $202     $80     $65     $1.73     32.2%     $97     47.8%       3Q24    $207     $87     $71     $1.90     34.6%     $105     50.8%       4Q23    $197     $77     $70     $1.84     35.3%     $99     50.0%       YoY % Change    3%     4%     (6%)     (6%)     (310) bps     (2%)     (220) bps       QoQ % Change    (2%)     (8%)     (9%)     (9%)     (240) bps     (8%)     (300) bps                                                         FY 2024    $817     $341     $274     $7.28     33.6%     $410     50.2%       FY 2023    $753     $315     $258     $6.85     34.3%     $383     50.9%       % Change    9%     8%     6%     6%     (70) bps     7%     (70) bps                 Table 1A: 4Q24 trading volume (ADV)      CREDIT  RATES     $ in millions(unaudited) US/UKTradingDays2 TotalADV TotalCredit High-Grade High-Yield EmergingMarkets Eurobonds MunicipalBonds TotalRates US Govt.Bonds Agcy./OtherGovt.Bonds    4Q24    62/64     $41,030     $13,883     $6,454     $1,345     $3,459     $2,001     $620     $27,147     $25,952     $1,195       3Q24    64/65     $40,516     $14,116     $7,027     $1,278     $3,333     $1,891     $577     $26,400     $25,302     $1,098       4Q23    62/63     $29,641     $13,108     $6,215     $1,653     $2,927     $1,767     $539     $16,533     $16,106     $427       YoY % Change          38%     6%     4%     (19%)     18%     13%     15%     64%     61%     180%       QoQ % Change          1%     (2%)     (8%)     5%     4%     6%     7%     3%     3%     9%                     Table 1B: 4Q24 estimated market share    CREDIT RATES    (unaudited)    High-Grade High-Yield High-Grade/High-YieldCombined Municipals3 US Govt.Bonds3    4Q24    18.4%     13.4%     17.3%     7.1%     2.8%       3Q24    19.5%     13.0%     18.1%     8.7%     2.6%       4Q23    20.9%     17.2%     20.0%     5.6%     2.0%       YoY Bps Change    (250) bps    (380) bps    (270) bps    +150 bps    +80 bps      QoQ Bps Change    (110) bps    +40 bps    (80) bps    (160) bps    +20 bps              4Q24 overview of results  Commission revenue and trading volume  Credit  Credit Commission Revenue   Total credit commission revenue of $162.2 million (including $32.8 million in fixed-distribution fees) increased $0.3 million, or 0.2%, compared to $161.9 million (including $34.6 million in fixed-distribution fees) in the prior year. Strong growth in our international product areas, including 18% growth in emerging markets and 10% growth in Eurobonds, was mostly offset by lower estimated market share in U.S. high grade, and historically low levels of credit spread volatility in U.S. high-yield, resulting in lower estimated market share. Variable transaction fees per million (“FPM”) were $150, compared to $156 in the prior year and $149 in 3Q24. The decline in FPM compared to the prior year was mainly due to product mix-shift, principally lower levels of U.S. high-yield activity. The decrease in fixed-distribution fees was principally driven by migrations to variable fee plans.    Credit Trading Volumes  U.S. Credit5   U.S. high-grade ADV of $6.5 billion increased 4% compared to the prior year, but decreased 8% compared to 3Q24. Estimated market ADV increased 18% compared to the prior year, but decreased 3% compared to 3Q24. Estimated market share was 18.4%, down from 20.9% in the prior year, and down from 19.5% in 3Q24. Including the impact of single-dealer portfolio trades, estimated market share was 18.8%, down from 21.0% in the prior year, and down from 20.0% in 3Q24.    U.S. high-yield ADV of $1.3 billion decreased 19% compared to the prior year, but increased 5% compared to 3Q24. Estimated market ADV increased 5% compared to the prior year, and increased 2% compared to 3Q24. Estimated market share was 13.4%, down from 17.2% in the prior year, but up from 13.0% in 3Q24. Including the impact of single-dealer portfolio trades, estimated market share was 13.7%, down from 17.3% in the prior year, but up from 13.4% in 3Q24.    Other Credit   Emerging markets ADV of $3.5 billion increased 18% compared to the prior year, and increased 4% compared to 3Q24. The year-over-year increase was driven by a 26% increase in hard currency ADV, and a 7% increase in local currency ADV.    Eurobonds ADV of $2.0 billion increased 13% compared to the prior year, and increased 6% compared to 3Q24.    Record municipal bond ADV of $620 million increased 15% compared to the prior year, and increased 7% compared to 3Q24. Estimated market ADV decreased 9% compared to the prior year, but increased 32% compared to 3Q24. Estimated market share was 7.1%, up from 5.6% in the prior year, but down from a record 8.7% in 3Q24.3   Strategic Priority Related Protocols & Workflow Tools   $1.1 billion in total portfolio trading ADV increased 57% compared to the prior year, but decreased 8% compared to 3Q24. A record 71% of portfolio trading volume was executed over X-Pro.   Estimated U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield TRACE portfolio trading market ADV was flat compared to 3Q24.      Our estimated market share of U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield TRACE portfolio trading was 16.2%, down from 20.0% in 3Q24.   Portfolio trading represented approximately 11% of U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield TRACE in 4Q24, in line with 3Q24.      Open Trading ADV of $4.1 billion increased 2% compared to the prior year, and was in line with 3Q24. Open Trading share4 of total credit trading volume was 35%, down from 36% in the prior year, but in line with 3Q24 levels.    Dealer RFQ ADV of $1.2 billion across all credit products increased 8% compared to the prior year, and increased 5% compared to 3Q24.    AxessIQ, the order and execution workflow solution designed for wealth management and private banking clients, achieved record ADV of $147 million, up 6% compared to the prior year, and up 14% compared to 3Q24.    Rates   Record total rates commission revenue of $7.3 million increased $2.5 million, or 53%. Record total rates ADV of $27.1 billion increased 64% compared to the prior year, and increased 3% compared to 3Q24. U.S. Treasury ADV on the platform in November 2023 was negatively impacted by an outage at ICBC, the third-party the Company was then using for U.S. Treasury settlement services.    Other   Total other commission revenue was $5.2 million, which consists of Pragma commission revenue.    Services revenue  Information services   Information services revenue of $13.2 million increased $1.2 million, or 10% compared to the prior year. The increase in revenue was principally driven by net new data contract revenue and an increase of $0.3 million from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.    Post-trade services   Post-trade services revenue of $11.0 million was flat compared to the prior year mainly due to an increase of $0.2 million from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, offset by lower end-of-year resubmissions revenue.    Technology services   Total technology services revenue of $3.5 million, up from $2.5 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher Pragma-related license fees.    Expenses   Total expenses of $122.4 million increased 2% from the prior year, including an increase of $0.9 million from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.    Non-operating   Other income (expense): Other income was $4.6 million, down from $6.8 million in the prior year. The current year includes an unrealized loss on U.S. Treasury investments of $1.9 million compared to an unrealized gain in the prior year of $0.9 million.    Tax rate: The effective tax rate was 23.0%, up from 16.9% in the prior year. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to lower one-time tax benefits recognized in 4Q24 compared to 4Q23.    Capital   The Company had $698.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, corporate bond investments and U.S. Treasury investments as of December 31, 2024, up from $602.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and $575.7 million as of December 31, 2023. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Company’s credit facility.    For the full year 2024, a total of 341,477 shares were repurchased at a cost of $75.0 million, including 63,873 shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of $16.4 million. As of January 31, 2025, a total of $220.0 million remained under the aggregate authorizations by the Company’s Board of Directors.    The Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.76 per share, payable on March 5, 2025 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 19, 2025.    Other   Employee headcount was 891 as of December 31, 2024, up from 881 as of December 31, 2023, and up from 881 as of September 30, 2024.    Guidance  For the full year 2025, the Company is providing the following guidance which is based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2024:    Services revenue (combined Information Services, Post-Trade Services and Technology Services) is expected to grow in the mid-single digits (percent).    Expenses are expected to be in the range of $505.0 million to $525.0 million. Based on the midpoint of the stated guidance range, total expenses are expected to increase by approximately 8%.    The effective tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% and 24.5%, assuming no material changes in applicable tax laws.    Capital expenditures to support new protocols, products and trading platform enhancements are expected to be in the range of $65.0 million to $70.0 million.           1   EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to “Non-GAAP financial measures and other items” for a discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures.      2   The number of U.S. trading days is based on the SIFMA holiday recommendation calendar and the number of U.K. trading days is based primarily on the U.K. bank holiday schedule.      3   See “General Notes Regarding the Data Presented” below.      4   Open Trading share of total credit trading volume is derived by taking total Open Trading volume across all credit products where Open Trading is offered and dividing by total credit trading volume across all credit products where Open Trading is offered.      5   The Company is currently highlighting the impact of single-dealer portfolio trading volume on U.S. high-grade and U.S. high-yield trading volume and estimated market share, but will continue to exclude single-dealer portfolio trading activity from each product’s aggregated trading volume and estimated market share and the total credit FPM calculation.            Non-GAAP financial measures and other items  To supplement the Company’s unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers, less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide additional information regarding the Company’s operating results because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and evaluating the performance of our business. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA, GAAP net income margin to EBITDA margin and GAAP net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities to free cash flow.   Please refer to Tables 6 & 7 for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.   Webcast and conference call information  Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, Richard Schiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, and Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Chief Financial Officer will host a conference call to discuss the Company’s financial results and outlook on Thursday, February 6, 2025 at 10:30 a.m. ET.

General Notes Regarding the Data Presented  Reported MarketAxess volume in all product categories includes only fully electronic trading volume. MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”) reported volumes are available on the Company’s website at investor.marketaxess.com/volume.   For periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (“MSRB”), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB “flags” to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank’s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA’s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share. Prior comparable periods have been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated presentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the Company’s website at investor.marketaxess.com/volume.

Snap-on Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206467415/en/Snap-on-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results,2025-02-06 12:00:00," KENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information and systems solutions for professional users performing critical tasks, today announced 2024 operating results for the fourth quarter and full year.    Net sales of $1,198.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 represented an increase of $2.1 million, or 0.2%, from 2023 levels, reflecting a $2.0 million, or 0.2%, organic gain and $2.1 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $2.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.     Operating earnings before financial services for the quarter of $265.2 million compared to $257.9 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating earnings before financial services were 22.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 21.6% last year.     Financial services revenue in the quarter of $100.5 million compared to $97.2 million in 2023; financial services operating earnings of $66.7 million compared to $67.9 million last year.     Consolidated operating earnings for the quarter of $331.9 million, or 25.5% of revenues (net sales plus financial services revenue), compared to $325.8 million, or 25.2% of revenues, in 2023.     The fourth quarter effective income tax rate was 22.5% in 2024 and 21.4% last year.     Net earnings in the quarter of $258.1 million, or $4.82 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $255.3 million, or $4.75 per diluted share, a year ago.     Full year net sales of $4,707.4 million in 2024 represented a decrease of $22.8 million, or 0.5%, from 2023 levels, reflecting a $40.6 million, or 0.9%, organic decline and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $23.3 million of acquisition-related sales. Full year net earnings of $1,043.9 million, or $19.51 per diluted share, compared to $1,011.1 million, or $18.76 per diluted share, in 2023, an increase of $32.8 million or $0.75 per diluted share. In 2024, net earnings included a $17.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, after-tax benefit for the final payments associated with a legal matter, which were received in the first six months of 2024.    See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a definition of, and further explanation about, organic sales.   “We are encouraged by our fourth quarter results as our businesses were again strong, achieving a positive balance and overall progress, with our operations serving critical industries and repair shop owners and managers advancing in both sales and profitability, and with the Snap-on Tools Group continuing to narrow the gap versus prior periods despite the environment of general uncertainty,” said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. “In addition to reconfirming the special resilience of our markets and our enterprise, rooted in essential repair, the quarter demonstrates the considerable capabilities of our team, as is evident in the Tools Group success, pivoting our advantages in product, brand, and people to better match the current preferences of technicians for quick payback items. As we proceed into 2025, we’ll enhance the franchise network by further refocusing our product development, manufacturing, and marketing, meeting the demands of the day, extend to critical industries by sharpening our ability to take full advantage of the growing need for customized solutions, and expand our already prominent position with shop owners and managers by serving the rising complexity of vehicle repair. At the same time, we’ll engage our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, driving improvements across the corporation that when combined with our runways for growth, we believe will author substantial and strategic gain. Finally, I want to thank our franchisees and our associates worldwide for their many contributions, for their steadfast dedication, and for their deep confidence in our prospects as we move forward through this 105th year of our company and significantly beyond.”   Segment Results - Fourth Quarter  Commercial & Industrial Group segment sales of $379.2 million in the quarter compared to $363.9 million last year, reflecting a $14.2 million, or 3.9%, organic gain and $2.1 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $1.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase is primarily due to higher sales to customers in critical industries, with particular progress in the specialty torque arena.   Operating earnings of $63.5 million in the period compared to $54.1 million in 2023. The operating margin (operating earnings as a percentage of segment sales) improved 180 basis points to 16.7% from 14.9% last year.   Snap-on Tools Group segment sales of $506.6 million in the quarter compared to $513.3 million last year, reflecting a $7.3 million, or 1.4%, organic sales decrease, partially offset by $0.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decline is due to lower activity in the U.S., partially offset by higher sales in the segment’s international operations.   Operating earnings of $106.9 million in the period compared to $111.0 million in 2023. The operating margin of 21.1% compared to 21.6% a year ago.   Repair Systems & Information Group segment sales of $456.6 million in the quarter compared to $450.8 million last year, reflecting a $7.3 million, or 1.6%, organic sales increase, partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes higher activity with OEM dealerships and increased sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, partially offset by lower volumes of undercar equipment.   Operating earnings of $121.4 million in the period compared to $113.3 million in 2023. The operating margin improved 150 basis points to 26.6% from 25.1% last year.   Financial Services operating earnings of $66.7 million on revenue of $100.5 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $67.9 million on revenue of $97.2 million a year ago. Originations of $285.1 million in the fourth quarter represented a decrease of $18.0 million, or 5.9%, from 2023 levels.   Corporate expenses in the fourth quarter of $26.6 million compared to $20.5 million last year.   Outlook  We believe that our markets and our operations possess and have demonstrated continuing and considerable resilience against the uncertainties of the current environment. In 2025, Snap-on expects to make ongoing progress along its decisive runways for coherent growth, leveraging capabilities already proven in the automotive repair arena, developing and expanding its professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including extending in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. In pursuit of these initiatives, we project that capital expenditures in 2025 will approximate $100 million.   Snap-on currently anticipates that its full-year 2025 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23%.

Non-GAAP Measures  References in this release to “organic sales” refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), adjusted to exclude acquisition-related sales and the impact of foreign currency translation. Management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth, which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output, expanded customer base, geographic expansion, new product development and pricing changes, and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prior-year reporting period. Organic sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in the company’s businesses and facilitates comparisons of its sales performance with prior periods.

management for assessing the operating performance of Snap-on Incorporated's (“Snap-on”) non-financial services (“Operations”) and Financial Services businesses.   The supplemental Operations data reflects the results of operations and financial position of Snap-on's tools, diagnostics, equipment products, software and other non-financial services operations with Financial Services presented on the equity method. The supplemental Financial Services data reflects the results of operations and financial position of Snap-on's U.S. and international financial services operations. The financing needs of Financial Services are met through intersegment borrowings and cash generated from Operations; Financial Services is charged interest expense on intersegment borrowings at market rates. Income taxes are charged to Financial Services on the basis of the specific tax attributes generated by the U.S. and international financial services businesses. Transactions between the Operations and Financial Services businesses are eliminated to arrive at the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Maximus Reports Fiscal Year 2025 First Quarter Results,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206450370/en/Maximus-Reports-Fiscal-Year-2025-First-Quarter-Results,2025-02-06 12:00:00," TYSONS, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Maximus (NYSE: MMS), a leading provider of government services worldwide, reported financial results for the three months ending December 31, 2024.     Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 include:    Revenue increased 5.7% to $1.40 billion, compared to $1.33 billion for the prior year period. Organic growth of 6.3% was due primarily to the U.S. Federal Services Segment with added contributions from the Outside the U.S. Segment.    Diluted earnings per share were $0.69 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.61, compared to $1.04 and $1.34, respectively, for the prior year period. The three months ending December 31, 2024, included divestiture-related charges resulting from the completed sale of the employment services businesses in Australia and South Korea in the Outside the U.S. Segment.    Earnings guidance is increasing, with adjusted EBITDA margin expected to be approximately 11.2% and adjusted diluted earnings per share expected to range between $5.90 and $6.20 per share for the full fiscal year 2025.    Purchases of Maximus common stock totaled 3.1 million shares for $237 million in the quarter, with additional purchases totaling 0.7 million shares for $52.9 million subsequent to December 31, 2024.    A quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share is payable on February 28, 2025, to shareholders of record on February 15, 2025.    ""Along with strong financials in our first quarter and an improvement to full-year earnings guidance, we have recently been successful in removing multiple contractual and business uncertainties that ultimately strengthen the durability of our business,"" said Bruce Caswell, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We had winning outcomes on the two large recompetes and the recent divestiture improves the health and predictability of our Outside the U.S. Segment.""   Caswell added, ""We believe that Maximus has a favorable and unique position in government services, with a recognized and proven track record administering critical government programs in an efficient and accountable manner. As our government customers, in both Federal agencies and state governments, face uncertainties and potential challenges, we believe Maximus is in a superior strategic position to provide value-added solutions and assistance.""   First Quarter Results  Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 increased 5.7% to $1.40 billion, compared to $1.33 billion for the prior year period. Organic growth totaled 6.3%, primarily due to the U.S. Federal Services Segment and, to a lesser degree, contributions from the Outside the U.S. Segment.   For the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, operating margin was 6.2% and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.2%. This compares to margins of 8.1% and 10.6%, respectively, for the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share were $0.69 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.61. This compares to $1.04 and $1.34, respectively, for the prior year period.   The first quarter of fiscal year 2025 included divestiture-related charges from the completed sale of the employment services businesses in Australia and South Korea as announced in December 2024. The charges totaled approximately $38 million and mostly related to accumulated foreign exchange losses since inception of operations in Australia. The divestiture-related charges drove a higher tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025.   U.S. Federal Services Segment  U.S. Federal Services Segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 increased 15.3% to $780.7 million, compared to $677.1 million reported for the prior year period. All growth was organic and resulted from a combination of clinical assessment volume, outsized volumes on other clinical programs, and customer service-type programs.   The segment operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was 12.7%, compared to 10.2% reported for the prior year period. The outsized volumes on other clinical programs benefited this quarter’s margin. The full-year fiscal 2025 margin for the U.S. Federal Services Segment is now expected to be approximately 11.5%.   U.S. Services Segment  U.S. Services Segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 decreased 7.7% to $452.3 million, compared to $489.8 million reported in the prior year period. The decrease resulted from the prior year period containing excess volumes from Medicaid-related activities, including the one-time unwinding exercise that drove extra redeterminations.   The segment operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was 9.0%, compared to 13.5% reported for the prior year. The margin disparity is due to a combination of the excess volumes benefiting the margin of the prior year period as well as seasonality factors that slightly reduced margin in the current period and were anticipated in the full year outlook. The full-year fiscal 2025 margin for the U.S. Services Segment is anticipated to be approximately 11%.   Outside the U.S. Segment  Outside the U.S. Segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 increased 6.0% to $169.8 million, compared to $160.1 million reported in the prior year period. Organic growth was 10.7% and driven primarily by strong performance on flagship contracts in the United Kingdom.   The segment operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was 4.8%, or $8.1 million operating profit, compared to an operating loss of $0.1 million in the prior year period. The multiple divestitures of employment services businesses over the last two years have reduced volatility and improved profitability in the segment.   Sales and Pipeline  Year-to-date signed contract awards at December 31, 2024, totaled $2.08 billion, and contracts pending (awarded but unsigned) totaled $410 million. The book-to-bill ratio at December 31, 2024, was 0.7x calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis, and 1.5x for the three months ending December 31, 2024.   The sales pipeline at December 31, 2024, totaled $41.4 billion, comprised of approximately $2.47 billion in proposals pending, $1.50 billion in proposals in preparation, and $37.5 billion in opportunities tracking. The reduction from the pipeline at September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to removal of the Contact Center Operations (CCO) early recompete and successful win of the Veterans Affairs Medical Disability Examination contracts recompete. New work opportunities represent approximately 57% of the total sales pipeline.   Balance Sheet and Cash Flows  At December 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $73 million, and gross debt was $1.40 billion. The ratio of debt, net of allowed cash, to EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement, was 1.8x and trended higher from increased purchases of Maximus common stock. This compares to 1.4x at September 30, 2024 and remains below the target net leverage range of 2x to 3x.   For the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, cash used in operating activities totaled $80.0 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $103.0 million. Negative cash flow was anticipated due to the timing of certain payments that often occur in the first fiscal quarter, while free cash flow guidance for the full fiscal year 2025 is increasing by $10 million. DSO at December 31, 2024, were 62 days, compared with 61 days at September 30, 2024.   During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we purchased approximately 3.1 million shares for $237 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, and through January 31, 2025, we purchased an additional 0.7 million shares for $52.9 million, leaving approximately $85.0 million remaining under the current Board of Directors authorization announced in December 2024.   On January 5, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 for each share of our common stock outstanding. The dividend is payable on February 28, 2025, to shareholders of record on February 15, 2025.   Raising Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Guidance  Maximus is raising earnings guidance and adjusting revenue guidance for fiscal year 2025. Revenue is now expected to range between $5.2 billion and $5.35 billion adjusting for the recent divestiture that removed approximately $100 million of revenue, and partially offset by increased organic growth.   An adjusted EBITDA margin, which excludes divestiture-related charges, of approximately 11.2% is anticipated for the full year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes expense for amortization of intangible assets and divestiture-related charges, is now expected to range between $5.90 and $6.20 per share for fiscal year 2025.   Free cash flow is now expected to range between $355 million and $385 million for fiscal year 2025. Interest expense is estimated to be $75 million for fiscal year 2025 and increased from prior guidance as a result of the higher purchase activity of Maximus common stock. The full year tax rate is now expected to range between 28% and 29% as a result of the higher tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. On a full-year basis, the weighted average shares outstanding is forecasted to be approximately 58 million shares for fiscal year 2025.

"ITT Reports Fourth Quarter Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.55, Adjusted EPS of $1.50; Reports Full Year EPS of $6.30, Adjusted EPS of $5.86",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206546298/en/ITT-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-EPS-of-1.55-Adjusted-EPS-of-1.50-Reports-Full-Year-EPS-of-6.30-Adjusted-EPS-of-5.86,2025-02-06 12:00:00," STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 6, 2025-- ITT Inc. (NYSE: ITT) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024. For the fourth quarter, the company reported a year-over-year revenue increase of 12%, up 6% on an organic basis, primarily driven by higher volume, pricing actions and the acquisitions of Svanehøj and kSARIA.   Fourth quarter operating income of $160 million increased 35% compared to prior year, and operating margin of 17.2% increased 290 basis points versus prior year primarily due to higher volume leverage, favorable price and cost actions, lower restructuring charges and the impact of a $15 million loss on sale in prior year. On an adjusted basis, operating income of $163 million increased 16% primarily due to higher volumes, pricing actions and productivity, partially offset by higher strategic growth investments and corporate costs.   Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of $1.55 increased 38% versus prior year primarily due to the impact of non-recurring items in prior year, higher operating income and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense related to acquisition debt. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share of $1.50 increased 12% compared to prior year due primarily to higher operating income.   Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of $223 million increased 31% versus prior year driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements, resulting in operating cash flow margin of 24%. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of $187 million increased 42% versus prior year, resulting in free cash flow margin of 20%. For the full year, operating cash flow of $563 million increased 5%, and free cash flow of $439 million increased 2%. Both increases were due to higher net income, improved accounts receivable collections and inventory management.   Table 1.

Management Commentary  “In 2024, our teams delivered on our commitments once again. We grew revenues 11% in total, 7% organically, with strength across all segments. Our businesses drove strong margin expansion and eclipsed our long-term margin target two years ahead of plan. We deployed over $860 million of capital through the acquisitions of cryogenic pump manufacturer, Svanehøj, and defense interconnect specialist, kSARIA. These acquisitions, coupled with the divestiture of our automotive component business, significantly enhanced ITT’s opportunities in higher growth and higher margin flow and connectors businesses whilst strategically shifting our portfolio. On top of this, we invested over $100 million in growth and productivity to further our differentiation, paid down over $500 million of debt related to M&A, and returned over $200 million of capital to shareholders. We entered 2025 with a $1.6 billion backlog, continued growth and margin expansion opportunities in our core and ramping value creation from our acquisitions,” said Luca Savi, ITT’s Chief Executive Officer and President.

Motion Technologies revenue decreased 11% due to the Wolverine divestiture in July 2024, partially offset by strength in rail and Friction’s automotive aftermarket. Operating income of $63 million increased 4% due to productivity, including supply chain savings, and lower material and overhead costs, partially offset by higher strategic investments.   Industrial Process revenue increased 25%, primarily due to the acquisition of Svanehøj and growth in pump projects and short cycle. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Operating income of $77 million increased 34% driven by increased volume, pricing and productivity actions, and lower restructuring charges.   Connect & Control Technologies revenue increased 37%, primarily due to the acquisition of kSARIA, as well as growth in defense and industrial connectors and pricing actions. Operating income of $40 million increased 142% due to the impact of a prior year loss on sale and current year benefits from pricing actions, productivity and contributions from kSARIA. This was partially offset by higher material, labor and overhead costs.

ITT’s Board of Directors approved the cash dividend for the first quarter of 2025, which will be payable on March 31, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 6, 2025. The 10% increase in the quarterly dividend announced today follows increases of 10% in both 2023 and 2024. Including the increase in 2025, the company’s dividend has grown at a 16% compounded annual growth rate since 2020.   2025 Guidance  We expect revenue growth of 2% to 4%, up 3% to 5% on an organic basis; operating margin of 18.0% to 18.9%, and adjusted operating margin of 18.1% to 19.0%, up 40 to 130 bps; EPS of $6.05 to $6.45, and adjusted EPS of $6.10 to $6.50; and free cash flow of $450 million to $500 million, representing free cash flow margin of 12% to 13% for full year 2025.   It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to estimate the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions, divestitures, and certain other special items that may occur in 2025 as these items are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. As a result, we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be included in a reconciliation of organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts and we have not provided reconciliations for these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.   Investor Conference Call Details  ITT’s management will host a conference call for investors on Thursday, February 6, 2025 at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The briefing can be accessed live via webcast which is available on the company’s website: https://investors.itt.com. A replay of the webcast will be available two hours after the presentation concludes. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial performance metrics to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics are defined and presented below and should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, the financial data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.   Safe Harbor Statement  This release contains “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, the conference call (including the financial results presentation material) may include, and officers and representatives of ITT may from time to time make and discuss, projections, goals, assumptions, and statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements”. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather represent only a belief regarding future events based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our business, future financial results, the industry in which we operate, and other legal, regulatory, and economic developments. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, future strategic plans and other statements that describe the company’s business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals, and any discussion of future events and future operating or financial performance.   We use words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” and other similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are uncertain and, by their nature, many are inherently unpredictable and outside of ITT’s control, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in, or reasonably inferred from, such forward-looking statements.   Where in any forward-looking statement we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is based on current plans and expectations of our management, expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, we cannot provide any assurance that the expectation or belief will occur or that anticipated results will be achieved or accomplished.   Among the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements are risks and uncertainties inherent in our business including, without limitation:    uncertain global economic and capital markets conditions, which have been influenced by heightened geopolitical tensions, inflation, changes in monetary policies, the threat of a possible regional or global economic recession, trade disputes between the U.S. and its trading partners, political and social unrest, and the availability and fluctuations in prices of energy and commodities, including steel, oil, copper and tin;    fluctuations in interest rates and the impact of such fluctuations on customer behavior and on our cost of debt;    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of such fluctuations on our revenues, customer demand for our products and on our hedging arrangements;    volatility in raw material prices and our suppliers’ ability to meet quality and delivery requirements;    impacts and risk of liabilities from recent mergers, acquisitions, or venture investments, and past divestitures and spin-offs;    our inability to hire or retain key personnel;    failure to compete successfully and innovate in our markets;    failure to manage the distribution of products and services effectively;    failure to protect our intellectual property rights or violations of the intellectual property rights of others;    the extent to which there are quality problems with respect to manufacturing processes or finished goods;    the risk of cybersecurity breaches or failure of any information systems used by the Company, including any flaws in the implementation of any enterprise resource planning systems;    loss of or decrease in sales from our most significant customers;    risks due to our operations and sales outside the U.S. and in emerging markets, including the imposition of tariffs and trade sanctions;    fluctuations in demand or customers’ levels of capital investment, maintenance expenditures, production, and market cyclicality;    the risk of material business interruptions, particularly at our manufacturing facilities;    risks related to government contracting, including changes in levels of government spending and regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the U.S. government;    fluctuations in our effective tax rate, including as a result of changing tax laws and other possible tax reform legislation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions;    changes in environmental laws or regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, or the failure of a potentially responsible party to perform;    failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (or other applicable anti-corruption legislation), export controls and trade sanctions; and    risk of product liability claims and litigation.

performance indicators including revenue, operating income and margin, earnings per share, order growth, and backlog. In addition, we consider certain measures to be useful to management and investors when evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented. These measures provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations and management of assets from period to period. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. Some of these metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators for purposes of our reconciliation tables.   Organic Revenues and Organic Orders are defined, respectively, as revenue and orders, excluding the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions, and divestitures that may or may not qualify as discontinued operations. Current year activity from acquisitions is excluded for twelve months following the closing date of acquisition. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency fluctuations is estimated using a fixed exchange rate for both the current and prior periods. Prior year revenue and orders are adjusted to exclude activity during the comparable period for twelve months post-closing date for divestitures that do not qualify as discontinued operations. We believe that reporting organic revenue and organic orders provide useful information to investors by helping identify underlying trends in our business and facilitating comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers.   Adjusted Operating Income is defined as operating income adjusted to exclude special items that include, but are not limited to, restructuring, certain asset impairment charges, certain acquisition- and divestiture-related impacts, and unusual or infrequent operating items. Special items represent charges or credits that impact current results, which management views as unrelated to the Company's ongoing operations and performance. Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as adjusted operating income divided by revenue. We believe these financial measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating ongoing operating profitability, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors.   Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations is defined as income from continuing operations attributable to ITT Inc. adjusted to exclude special items that include, but are not limited to, restructuring, certain asset impairment charges, certain acquisition- and divestiture-related impacts, income tax settlements or adjustments, and unusual or infrequent items. Special items represent charges or credits, on an after-tax basis, that impact current results, which management views as unrelated to the Company’s ongoing operations and performance. The after-tax basis of each special item is determined using the jurisdictional tax rate of where the expense or benefit occurred and the tax deductibility under local tax rules. Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share (Adjusted EPS) is defined as adjusted income from continuing operations divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. We believe that adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating ongoing operating profitability, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors.   Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow Margin is defined as free cash flow divided by revenue. We believe that free cash flow and free cash flow margin provide useful information to investors as it provides insight into a primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated by our operations.

It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to estimate the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions, divestitures, and certain other special items that may occur in 2025 as these items are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. As a result, the Company is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be included in a reconciliation of organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts and accordingly has not provided reconciliations for these forward looking non-GAAP financial measures.           ITT Inc.

Mercer Advisors Appoints Alisa Maute as Head of Client Development,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206977736/en/Mercer-Advisors-Appoints-Alisa-Maute-as-Head-of-Client-Development,2025-02-06 11:38:00," DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mercer Global Advisors, Inc. (“Mercer Advisors”), a national Registered Investment Adviser (RIA), today announced the hiring of Alisa Maute, CIMA®, CAIA℠, to the newly created role of executive managing director, head of client development. Maute joins Mercer Advisors to lead and expand its dedicated client development team, comprising more than 100 team members, which has doubled in size over the past two years and is powering record organic growth for the firm.     Mercer Advisors’ dedicated client development function allows advisors to devote their time and energy to serving their existing clients, instead of finding new ones. Client development professionals work to identify prospective clients and thoughtfully pair them with an advisor best suited to solve for the complexities of their financial lives. In her new role, Maute will be responsible for coaching and developing these client development professionals, evolving each of the firm’s go-to-market channels and working with market leadership teams to develop bespoke growth strategies for their geographies. Maute will continue to build on the firm’s client-focused, collaborative and highly consultative approach to client development, which prioritizes creating high-quality and long-lasting advisory relationships with families across the wealth spectrum.   “One of the things that truly sets Mercer Advisors apart is our commitment to investing in dedicated client development teams in every one of our markets. It is a big part of how we deliver on our fiduciary promise to clients, while creating the context for advisors to do their best work,” said Daniel Gourvitch, President at Mercer Advisors. “Our CEO Dave (Welling) and I are extraordinarily proud of what this team has accomplished over the last several years. Bringing on a leader of Alisa’s caliber strengthens this vision, affording us the opportunity to positively impact the financial lives of more families across the country.”   Maute joins Mercer Advisors from LPL Financial, where she was an executive vice president and worked with hundreds of leading advisory firms across the country. At LPL, Maute was head of advisor growth, partnering with firms across the country to drive their organic expansion. Most recently, she served as head of investment product management and retirement, overseeing the firm’s investing solutions. Prior to LPL, Maute spent 14 years at WisdomTree Asset Management in various roles. She served on the firm’s operating committee and held key positions, including head of strategic partnerships and head of U.S. distribution.   “Over the past two decades, I’ve had the privilege of working with hundreds of the nation’s top independent advisory firms, large and small. And even among that group, Mercer Advisors clearly stood out to me,” said Maute. “Being able to deliver this level of family office services for clients across the country, including for some of the most sophisticated and demanding clients, is distinct and compelling. I am thrilled to join this incredible leadership team to uphold that commitment to the families that have entrusted us with their livelihoods–and to help thousands more find their way to Mercer Advisors.”   The appointment of Maute is Mercer Advisors’ third key hire in the past twelve months. In September, the firm appointed Elizabeth Hioe as its chief people officer, responsible for aligning talent strategy and human resources programs with the company’s strategy. And last February, the firm appointed Gün Keresteci as its chief financial officer.   “Mercer Advisors is a partnership of professionals who have decided to work together because we believe that we can deliver better outcomes to clients by working as a unified team,” added Welling. “Alisa is an extraordinary leader who shares our client-first approach and brings a depth of expertise in leading and building client development teams. We are committed to getting better as we get bigger, and Alisa’s leadership will undoubtedly be instrumental in enhancing our ability to serve more families with excellence.”   About Mercer Advisors  Mercer Advisors, the #1 ranked RIA firm in the nation according to the Barron’s 2024 Top 100 Registered Investment Advisor Firms, was founded in 1985.

Rates ADV was up 15.2% from prior year period, driven by record ADV in U.S. government bonds and mortgages, as well as strong year-over-year growth in swaps/swaptions < 1-year. The addition of r8fin continued to contribute to wholesale volumes. European government bonds reported a 18.6% ADV increase from prior year period, driven by increased client adoption of our diverse trading protocols. Mortgages reached record ADV, up 22.0% from prior year period, driven by strong specified pool volumes and to-be-announced (""TBA"") volumes, which were largely supported by elevated roll trading activity.   Credit – Revenues of $113.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased 8.9% compared to prior year period (increased 9.1% on a constant currency basis). Credit ADV was up 13.3% from prior year period, driven by strong activity in credit derivatives and U.S. credit volumes, including record ADV in fully electronic U.S. high yield credit. U.S. credit ADV was up 23.7% from prior year period, reflecting continued client adoption across Tradeweb products and protocols, including request-for-quote (""RFQ""), Tradeweb AllTrade® and portfolio trading. European Credit ADV was up 11.6% from prior year period, driven by robust activity across a wide range of protocols including Tradeweb's Automated Intelligent Execution tool (""AiEX""), Tradeweb AllTrade® and our unique dealer selection tool, SNAP IOI. We reported 18.3% share of fully electronic U.S. high grade TRACE, up 102 basis points (bps) from prior year period, and a record 7.9% share of fully electronic U.S. high yield TRACE, up 120 bps from prior year period.   Equities – Revenues of $28.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased 10.3% compared to prior year period (increased 10.6% on a constant currency basis). Equities ADV remained relatively flat, up 0.1% from prior year period. Volumes were driven by higher European ETF volumes and an increased number of clients utilizing our RFQ offering.   Money Markets – Revenues of $44.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased 166.5% compared to prior year period (increased 165.5% on a constant currency basis). Money Markets ADV was up 82.5% from prior year period, primarily driven by contributions from the August 1, 2024 acquisition of ICD and record ADV in global repurchase agreements, which was led by increased client activity across the platform.   Market Data – Revenues of $30.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased 15.8% compared to prior year period (increased 15.9% on a constant currency basis). The increase was derived primarily from increased LSEG market data fees from our market data agreement that was amended effective as of November 1, 2023, as well as an increase in proprietary third party market data revenue.   Other – Revenues of $6.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased 21.1% compared to prior year period (increased 21.0% on a constant currency basis).   Operating Expenses of $274.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased 20.3% compared to $228.4 million in the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and benefits as a result of increases in headcount to support our continued growth and an increase in incentive compensation expense tied to our financial performance, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to the assets acquired in connection with the 2024 acquisitions of ICD and r8fin and an increase in technology and communication expense due to continued investment in our data strategy and infrastructure and increased clearance and data fees driven primarily by higher trading volumes from prior year period. Given the strong environment to invest for long-term growth, during the fourth quarter of 2024, we also accelerated certain discretionary investments in marketing, consulting, digital assets and client relationship development.   Adjusted Expenses of $236.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased 24.8% (increased 25.2% on a constant currency basis) compared to prior year period primarily due to an increase in employee compensation and benefits as a result of increases in headcount to support our continued growth and an increase in incentive compensation expense tied to our financial performance and an increase in technology and communication expense due to continued investment in our data strategy and infrastructure and increased clearance and data fees driven primarily by higher trading volumes from prior year period.

(unless the context otherwise requires, together with its subsidiaries, referred to as “we,” “our,” “Tradeweb,” “Tradeweb Markets” or the “Company”) closed its IPO on April 8, 2019. As a result of certain reorganization transactions (the “Reorganization Transactions”) completed in connection with the IPO, on April 4, 2019, Tradeweb Markets Inc. became a holding company whose principal assets consist of its direct and indirect equity interest in Tradeweb Markets LLC (“TWM LLC”) and related deferred tax assets. As the sole manager of TWM LLC, Tradeweb Markets Inc. operates and controls all of the business and affairs of TWM LLC and, through TWM LLC and its subsidiaries, conducts its business. As a result of this control, and because Tradeweb Markets Inc. has a substantial financial interest in TWM LLC, Tradeweb Markets Inc. consolidates the financial results of TWM LLC and its subsidiaries.   Numerical figures included in this release have been subject to rounding adjustments and as a result totals may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the amounts that precede them and figures expressed as percentages may not total 100%.   Please refer to the Company's previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K for capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein.   UNAUDITED INTERIM AND FULL YEAR RESULTS  The interim and full year financial results presented herein for the three months and the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are unaudited.   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements related to, among other things, our guidance, including full-year 2025 guidance and full-year 2025 revenue guidance related to the LSEG market data license agreement, pending and completed acquisitions, future performance, the industry and markets in which we operate, our expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, prospects and assumptions and future events are forward-looking statements.   We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These and other important factors, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in the documents of Tradeweb Markets Inc. on file with or furnished to the SEC, may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this release are not guarantees of future events or performance and future events, our actual results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, and the development of the industry and markets in which we operate, may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this release. In addition, even if future events, our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, and events in the industry and markets in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this release, they may not be predictive of events, results or developments in future periods. Any forward-looking statement that we make in this release speaks only as of the date of such statement. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise, or to publicly announce any update or revision to, any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this release.   NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  This release contains “non-GAAP financial measures,” including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per diluted share (""Adjusted Diluted EPS""), Adjusted Expenses, Free Cash Flow and constant currency change, which are supplemental financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We make use of non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating our past results and future prospects. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.   Management and our board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin to assess our financial performance and believe they are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Further, our executive incentive compensation is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA.   We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS as supplemental metrics to evaluate our business performance in a way that also considers our ability to generate profit without the impact of certain items. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments included in Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS help to provide management with a measure of our operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations or are non-cash expenses.   We use Adjusted Expenses as a supplemental metric to evaluate our underlying operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations or are non-cash expenses.   We use Free Cash Flow to assess our liquidity in a way that considers the amount of cash generated from our core operations after non-acquisition related expenditures for capitalized software development costs and furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements.   We present certain changes on a “constant currency” basis. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate non-U.S. dollar revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars. Constant currency change, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as change excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. Constant currency information is calculated by translating the current period and prior period’s results using the annual average exchange rates for the prior period. We use constant currency change as a supplemental metric to evaluate our underlying performance between periods by removing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We present certain constant currency change information because we believe it provides investors and analysts a useful comparison of our results and trends between periods. This information should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.   See the attached schedules for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this release to their most comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as alternatives to net income attributable to Tradeweb Markets Inc., net income, net income margin, earnings per share, operating income, operating expenses, cash flow from operating activities or any other financial measure prepared or derived in accordance with GAAP. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment included in the reconciliations. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted EBT, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted Expenses and Free Cash Flow, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures.   Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.   MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA  This release includes estimates regarding market and industry data that we prepared based on our management’s knowledge and experience in the markets in which we operate, together with information obtained from various sources, including publicly available information, industry reports and publications, surveys, our clients, trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which we operate. In presenting this information, we have made certain assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on such data and other similar sources and on our knowledge of, and our experience to date in, the markets in which we operate. While such information is believed to be reliable for the purposes used herein, no representations are made as to the accuracy or completeness thereof and we take no responsibility for such information.   TRADEWEB SOCIAL MEDIA  Investors and others should note that Tradeweb announces material financial and operational information using its investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts. Information about Tradeweb, its business and its results of operations may also be announced by posts on the Company’s accounts on the following social media channels: Instagram, LinkedIn and X. The information that we post through these social media channels may be deemed material. As a result, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in Tradeweb to monitor these social media channels in addition to following our investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts.

Xcel Energy 2024 Year End Earnings Report,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206336663/en/Xcel-Energy-2024-Year-End-Earnings-Report,2025-02-06 11:35:00," MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: XEL) today reported 2024 GAAP earnings of $1.94 billion, or $3.44 per share, compared with $1.77 billion, or $3.21 per share in the same period in 2023 and ongoing earnings of $1.97 billion, or $3.50 per share, compared with $1.85 billion, or $3.35 per share in the same period in 2023. See Note 6 for reconciliation from GAAP to ongoing earnings.   The change in ongoing earnings reflect increased recovery of infrastructure investments, partially offset by higher depreciation, interest charges and O&M expenses.   “In 2024, we delivered on our earnings guidance for the 20th year in a row - one of the best track records in the industry - against a very difficult backdrop of challenges throughout the year. We significantly increased our investments in the infrastructure and technology that serves to protect and enhance the electrical systems for the benefit of our customers and communities,” said Bob Frenzel, chairman, president and CEO of Xcel Energy.   “As we look forward into 2025, we are executing on our plans to build the energy grid that is needed to meet the unprecedented increases in demand from our customers, protect against extreme weather, and deliver a compelling customer experience. We are excited for the future and to make energy work better for our customers and communities.”   At 9:00 a.m. CST today, Xcel Energy will host a conference call to review financial results.

INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Investor Relations Earnings Release (Unaudited)   Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy’s operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.   Non-GAAP Financial Measures  The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as ongoing return on equity (ROE), ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted EPS. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that adjusts measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Xcel Energy’s management uses non-GAAP measures for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining performance-based compensation and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures.   Ongoing ROE  Ongoing ROE is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity’s average stockholder’s equity. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.   Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)  GAAP diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled. The weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy Inc.’s diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method. Ongoing earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP earnings (net income) for certain items. Ongoing diluted EPS for Xcel Energy is calculated by dividing net income or loss, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period. Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss for such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.   We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of Xcel Energy’s core earnings and underlying performance. For instance, to present ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted earnings per share, we may adjust the related GAAP amounts for certain items that are non-recurring in nature. We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.   Note 1. Earnings Per Share Summary  Xcel Energy’s 2024 GAAP earnings were $3.44 per share compared to $3.21 per share in 2023 and ongoing earnings were $3.50 per share in 2024, compared with $3.35 per share in 2023. The change in earnings per share was driven by increased recovery of infrastructure investments, partially offset by higher depreciation, interest charges and O&M expenses. Fluctuations in electric and natural gas revenues associated with changes in fuel and purchased power and/or natural gas sold and transported generally do not significantly impact earnings (changes in costs are offset by the related variation in revenues). See Note 6 for reconciliation of GAAP earnings to ongoing earnings.

NSP-Minnesota — GAAP earnings increased $0.13 per share and ongoing earnings increased $0.15 per share for 2024 compared to 2023. Ongoing earnings increased due to higher recovery of electric and natural gas infrastructure investments, partially offset by increased depreciation and interest charges. See Note 6 for reconciliation from GAAP to ongoing earnings.   PSCo — GAAP earnings increased $0.13 per share and ongoing earnings increased $0.06 per share for 2024. Higher ongoing earnings primarily reflects higher recovery of electric and natural gas infrastructure investments, which was partially offset by increased depreciation, O&M and interest charges. See Note 6 for reconciliation from GAAP to ongoing earnings.   SPS — GAAP earnings were flat and ongoing earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2024. Ongoing earnings were impacted by increased depreciation, O&M and interest charges, largely offset by regulatory rate outcomes and sales growth. See Note 6 for reconciliation from GAAP to ongoing earnings.   NSP-Wisconsin — GAAP and ongoing earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2024. The decrease in ongoing earnings was primarily a result of higher depreciation.   Xcel Energy Inc. and Other — Primarily includes financing costs and interest income at the holding company and earnings from investment funds, which are accounted for as equity method investments. The decline in earnings for 2024 is largely due to higher debt levels and increased interest rates, partially offset by a gain on debt repurchases.

Regulated Utility Results  Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings — Unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related operating expenses that could result due to storm activity or vegetation management requirements. As a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy’s financial performance. However, electric sales true-up and gas decoupling mechanisms in Minnesota predominately mitigate the positive and adverse impacts of weather in that jurisdiction.   Normal weather conditions are defined as either the 10, 20 or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. To calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. Extreme weather variations, windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized estimates.

Residential sales declined due to a 1.5% decrease in use per customer, partially offset by a 1.4% increase in customers. The decline in C&I sales was due to lower use per customer, particularly in the manufacturing sector.    PSCo — Residential sales increased due to a 1.4% increase in customers, partially offset by a 0.7% decrease in use per customer. The decline in C&I sales was attributable to decreased use per customer, particularly in the wholesale trade and mining.    SPS — Residential sales declined due to a 2.2% decrease in use per customer partially offset by a 0.7% increase in customers. C&I sales increased due to higher use per customer, primarily driven by the energy sector and cryptocurrency mining.    NSP-Wisconsin — Residential sales declined due to a 2.7% decrease in use per customer, offset by a 1.0% increase in customers. The C&I sales decline was associated with lower use per customer, experienced particularly in the professional services and manufacturing sectors.    Annual weather-normalized and leap year adjusted natural gas sales growth (decline)   Natural gas sales reflect 1.7% residential use per customer and 1.4% C&I use per customer decreases. Partially offsetting these were increased residential and C&I customers in all jurisdictions.    Electric Revenues — Electric revenues are impacted by fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium, regulatory outcomes, market prices and seasonality. In addition, electric customers receive a credit for PTCs generated (wind, nuclear, and solar), which reduce electric revenue and income taxes.

These incurred expenses are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are largely offset in operating revenues and have minimal earnings impact.   Electric fuel and purchased power expenses decreased $490 million in 2024. The decrease is primarily due to timing of fuel recovery mechanisms and lower commodity prices, partially offset by increased volumes.   Cost of Natural Gas Sold and Transported — Expenses incurred for the cost of natural gas sold are impacted by market prices and seasonality. These costs are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are largely offset in operating revenues and have minimal earnings impact.   Natural gas sold and transported decreased $505 million in 2024. The decrease is primarily due to lower commodity prices and volumes.   O&M Expenses — O&M expenses increased $96 million in 2024 primarily due to operational activities, including generation maintenance, storm response, wildfire mitigation costs and damage prevention. The impact of prior year regulatory deferrals also contributed to increased O&M expenses, partially offset by lower labor and benefit costs and lower bad debt expenses.   Depreciation and Amortization — Depreciation and amortization increased $296 million for the year, primarily related to system expansion, partially offset by the impacts of various rate cases, including recognition of previously deferred costs as well as wind and nuclear life extensions.   Other Income — Other income increased $121 million for the year, primarily related to interest earned on significant cash balances throughout the year and a gain on debt repurchases, which helped to offset increased spending in our electric and natural gas operations to reduce risk, including wildfire mitigation.   Interest Charges — Interest charges increased $200 million in 2024. The increase was largely due to higher long-term debt levels to fund capital investments and higher interest rates.   AFUDC, Equity and Debt — AFUDC increased $99 million in 2024. This increase was largely due to increased investment in renewable and transmission projects.

Nuclear PTCs, newly available in 2024, resulted in benefits of 103.9% and 11.3% to the effective tax rate for the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2024, respectively.      (b)   Plant regulatory differences primarily relate to the credit of excess deferred taxes to customers. Income tax benefits associated with the credit are offset by corresponding revenue reductions.      Note 3.

Note 4. Rates, Regulation and Other  NSP-Minnesota — 2024 Electric Rate Case — In November 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed an electric rate case in Minnesota, seeking a total revenue increase of $491 million (13.2%) over two years, based on an ROE of 10.3%, a 52.5% equity ratio and rate base of $13.2 billion in 2025 and $14 billion in 2026. NSP-Minnesota also requested interim rates of $224 million for 2025. In December 2024, the MPUC reduced the interim rate request for wildfire mitigation costs (as these costs were deemed as new costs not previously approved in a rate case) and approved interim rates of $192 million, effective January 1, 2025. A decision is expected in 2026.   NSP-Minnesota — 2024 North Dakota Electric Rate Case — In December 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC) for an annual electric rate increase of approximately $45 million, or 19.3% over current rates established in 2021. The filing is based on a 2025 forecast test year and includes a requested return on equity of 10.3%, rate base of approximately $817 million and an equity ratio of 52.50%. In January 2025, NDPSC approved interim rates, subject to refund, of approximately $27 million (implemented on Feb. 1, 2025).   NSP-Minnesota — 2024 Minnesota Natural Gas Rate Case — In November 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for a natural gas rate increase of approximately $59 million, or 9.6%. The request was based on a ROE of 10.2%, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2024 forward test year with rate base of approximately $1.27 billion. In December 2023, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s request for interim rates, subject to refund, of approximately $51 million (implemented on Jan. 1, 2024).   In June 2024, NSP-Minnesota and various parties filed an uncontested settlement, which includes the following terms:    Natural gas rate increase of $46 million, or 7.5%.    ROE of 9.6%.    Equity ratio of 52.5%.    Rate base of $1.25 billion.    No change to Commission approved decoupling.    In October 2024, an ALJ recommended the MPUC approve the rate case settlement. A MPUC decision and order is expected in the first quarter of 2025.   NSP-Minnesota — North Dakota Natural Gas Rate Case — In December 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the NDPSC seeking an increase in natural gas rates of $8.5 million (9.4%), based on a ROE of 10.20%, an equity ratio of 52.5%, 2024 test year and rate base of $168 million.   In November 2024, the NDPSC approved a settlement, reflecting a natural gas rate increase of $7.2 million (8.0%), based on a ROE of 9.9% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. Rates were implemented on Jan. 1, 2025.   NSP-Minnesota — Minnesota 2023 Fuel Clause Adjustment — In March 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed its annual fuel clause adjustment true-up petition to the MPUC.   In 2024, the DOC recommended customer refunds for 2023 replacement power costs incurred during an outage at the Prairie Island generating station (October 2023 through February 2024). NSP-Minnesota estimates that customer refunds would be approximately $22 million if the DOC recommendations are applied to both 2023 and 2024.   In September 2024, the MPUC ruled NSP-Minnesota was imprudent in the operation of the Prairie Island nuclear plant based on an incident that resulted in the extended outage. The MPUC did not quantify the refund and referred the determination of the refund amount to the Office of Administrative Hearings. NSP-Minnesota has recorded an estimated liability for a customer refund.   The procedural schedule is as follows:    Xcel Energy testimony: May 1, 2025    Intervenor direct testimony: July 2, 2025    Rebuttal testimony: August 13, 2025    ALJ Report: March 16, 2026    NSP-Minnesota — 2024 Minnesota Resource Plan Settlement — In February 2024, NSP filed its Upper Midwest Resource Plan with the MPUC. In October 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed a settlement with several parties reaching agreement on the resource plan, as well as the proposed projects to be approved in the pending 800 MW firm dispatchable resource acquisition.   NSP-Minnesota anticipates a MPUC decision in the first quarter of 2025 and will file a related RFP for remaining resource needs upon approval. The settlement included the following key items:    The selection of the company-owned 420 MW Lyon County combustion turbine.    The selection of the company-owned 300 MW 4-hour Sherco battery energy storage system.    Multiple PPAs to proceed to the negotiation stage.    The addition of 3,200 MW of wind, 400 MW of solar and 600 MW of stand-alone storage to be added through 2030 based on an RFP process. Approximately 2,800 MW of wind resources are projected to utilize the Minnesota Energy Connection transmission line.    Planned life extensions of the Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear plants through the early 2050s.    NSP-Wisconsin — Wisconsin 2025 Stay-Out Proposal — In June 2024, NSP-Wisconsin filed a 2025 stay-out proposal with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW). In December 2024, the PSCW approved NSP-Wisconsin’s filing, which offsets $27 million in electric deficiencies and $3 million in natural gas deficiencies by amortizing Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) deferrals, stopping a deferral related to IRA benefits ordered in a previous rate case, and deferring revenue requirement impacts of two natural gas capital projects.   PSCo — Colorado Natural Gas Rate Case — In January 2024, PSCo, filed a request with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) seeking an increase to retail natural gas rates of $171 million (9.5%). The request was based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55%, a 2023 test year and a $4.2 billion year-end rate base.   In October 2024, the CPUC issued an order including the following key decisions:    Use of a historic 2023 test year, with a 13-month average rate base.    Weighted-average cost of capital of 7.0%, based on an ROE range of 9.2%-9.5% and an equity ratio range of 52%-55%.    Acceleration of $15 million per year of depreciation expense (incremental to PSCo’s original rate request), to be held in an external trust for future decommissioning costs.    Modifications to recoverability of certain operating expenses.    Denial of PSCo’s decoupling proposal.    PSCo placed new rates into effect in November, with an annual revenue increase of approximately $125 million, inclusive of $15 million of accelerated depreciation.   PSCo — 2024 Colorado Electric Resource Plan — In October 2024, PSCo filed its electric resource plan, known as the Just Transition Solicitation, with the CPUC. The filing reflects the expected growth on the system, the generation resources needed to meet the projected growth and the future evaluation of competitive bids for new generation resources.    The plan reflects a base sales forecast with 7% compound annual sales growth through 2031.    The plan also presents a low sales forecast with a 3% compound annual sales growth through 2031.    The resource plan includes forecasted need of 5-14 GW of new generation capacity through 2031, including renewables and firm dispatchable resources to meet the two different scenarios. The acquisitions of generation resources will be determined through a competitive solicitation after the CPUC determines the portfolio. The table below summarizes two of the proposed portfolios based on the different sales scenarios:      (Megawatts)          Base Plan          Low Load      Wind           7,250           2,800       Solar           3,077           1,200       Natural gas combustion turbine           1,575           1,400       Storage (long duration)           1,600           —       Other storage           450           —       Total          13,952           5,400      The procedural schedule is as follows:    Answer testimony: April 18, 2025    Rebuttal testimony: May 23, 2025    Settlement deadline: June 2, 2025    Hearing: June 10-20, 2025    Statements of position: July 14, 2025    A CPUC decision on the resource plan is expected by the fall of 2025 (Phase I) with the competitive solicitation for resource additions expected in early 2026.   PSCo — Wildfire Mitigation Plan — In June 2024, PSCo filed an Updated Wildfire Mitigation Plan (the WMP) and request for recovery of costs covering the years 2025 to 2027 with the CPUC. The estimated total cost for this plan is approximately $1.9 billion. A CPUC decision is expected in the third quarter of 2025.   The WMP integrates industry experience; incorporates evolving risk assessment methodologies; adds new technology; and expands the scope, pace and scale of our work to reduce wildfire risk in a comprehensive and efficient manner under four core programs that include the following:    Situational awareness – Meteorology, area risk mapping and modeling, artificial intelligence cameras and continuous monitoring.    Operational mitigations – Enhanced powerline safety settings and public safety power shutoffs (PSPS).    System resiliency – Asset assessment and remediations, pole replacements, line rebuilds, targeted undergrounding and vegetation management.    Customer support – Coordination and real-time data sharing with customers and other stakeholders and PSPS resiliency rebates.    The procedural schedule is as follows:    Answer testimony: Feb. 14, 2025    Rebuttal testimony: March 21, 2025    Settlement deadline: April 11, 2025    Hearing: May 5-15, 2025    Decision deadline: Aug. 28, 2025    PSCo — Excess Liability Insurance Deferral — In August 2024, PSCo filed a request with the CPUC to establish a tracker to defer differences in excess liability insurance premiums after the October 2024 policy renewal (reflecting significantly rising premiums of approximately $40 million, largely associated with wildfire risks throughout the United States) and amounts currently recovered. In January 2025, the CPUC approved a one-year deferral aligned with the current insurance policy year. Cost recovery for incremental insurance premiums will be reviewed in a future rate case.   SPS — New Mexico Resource Plan (IRP) — In October 2023, SPS filed its IRP with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC), which supports projected load growth and increasing reliability requirements, and secures replacement energy and capacity for retiring resources. SPS’ projected resource needs ranging from approximately 5,300 MW to 10,200 MW by 2030. In February 2024, the NMPRC accepted the IRP.   In July 2024, SPS issued a RFP, seeking approximately 3,200 MW of accredited generation capacity by 2030. The total capacity to be added to the system is expected to align with the range identified in the SPS IRP, depending on the types of resources proposed in the RFP and their accredited capacity factors.   The RFP portfolio selection is expected in May 2025. SPS is expected to file for a certificate of need for the recommended portfolio in the summer of 2025. The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) and NMPRC are expected to rule on the portfolio in 2026.   SPS — System Resiliency Plan — In December 2024, SPS filed its Texas System Resiliency Plan (SRP) with the PUCT. Consistent with PUCT requirements, SPS’ proposed plan discusses resiliency-related risks and the five measures that have been designed to help SPS prevent, withstand, mitigate or more promptly recover from resiliency events, including wildfire.   The SRP includes the following measures:    Distribution overhead hardening — Replacing and reinforcing key components of the distribution overhead system.    Distribution system protection modernization — Installing enhanced reclosers, communications equipment and replacing substation relay panels and breakers.    Communication modernization — Building out a private LTE network, installing fiber optic cable and adding remote terminal units.    Operational flexibility — Procuring mobile substation equipment and installing additional switching devices.    Wildfire mitigation — Weather stations, modeling, deploying artificial intelligence and vegetation management.    The plan covers 2025-2028 and includes the following total spend:     (Millions of Dollars)          Capital          O&M          Total      Distribution overhead hardening           $     253           $     —           $     253       Distribution system protection modernization                 92                 —                 92       Communication modernization                 112                 —                 112       Operational flexibility                 44                 —                 44       Wildfire mitigation                 20                 17                 37       Total           $     521           $     17           $     538      A procedural schedule is expected in the first quarter of 2025 and a PUCT decision is expected in the summer of 2025.   Note 5. Wildfire Litigation  2024 Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex — On February 26, 2024, multiple wildfires began in the Texas Panhandle, including the Smokehouse Creek Fire and the 687 Reamer Fire, which burned into the perimeter of the Smokehouse Creek Fire (together, referred to herein as the “Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex”). The Texas A&M Forest Service issued incident reports that determined that the Smokehouse Creek Fire and the 687 Reamer Fire were caused by power lines owned by SPS after wooden poles near each fire origin failed. According to the Texas A&M Forest Service’s Incident Viewer and news reports, the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex burned approximately 1,055,000 acres.   SPS is aware of approximately 25 complaints, most of which have also named Xcel Energy Services Inc. as an additional defendant, relating to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex. The complaints generally allege that SPS’ equipment ignited the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex and seek compensation for losses resulting from the fire, asserting various causes of action under Texas law. In addition to seeking compensatory damages, certain of the complaints also seek exemplary damages. SPS has also received approximately 199 claims for losses related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex through its claims process and has reached final settlements on 113 of those claims as of the date of this filing. In addition to filed complaints and claims made through SPS’ claims process, SPS has also received information from attorneys for claims related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex which have not been submitted through the claims process and have also not been filed as lawsuits, and has reached settlement of a portion of those claims. SPS anticipates additional complaints and demands will be made. As of December 2024, SPS has settled claims related to both of the fatalities believed to be associated with the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex.   Texas law does not apply strict liability in determining an electric utility company’s liability for fire-related damages. For negligence claims under Texas law, a public utility has a duty to exercise ordinary and reasonable care.   Potential liabilities related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex depend on various factors, including the cause of the equipment failure and the extent and magnitude of potential damages, including damages to residential and commercial structures, personal property, vegetation, livestock and livestock feed (including replacement feed), personal injuries and any other damages, penalties, fines or restitution that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities if SPS is found to have been negligent.   Based on the current state of the law and the facts and circumstances available as of the date of this filing, Xcel Energy believes it is probable that it will incur a loss in connection with the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex and accordingly has recorded a total of $215 million of estimated losses for the matter (before available insurance). Settlements reached as of the date of this filing total $73 million of expected loss payments, of which $35 million were paid in 2024, resulting in a remaining estimated liability of $180 million presented in other current liabilities as of Dec. 31, 2024.   The cumulative estimated probable losses of $215 million for complaints and claims in connection with the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex (before available insurance) corresponds to the lower end of the range of Xcel Energy’s reasonably estimable range of losses, and is subject to change based on additional information. This $215 million estimate does not include, among other things, amounts for (i) potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities on Xcel Energy, (ii) exemplary or punitive damages, (iii) compensation claims by federal, state, county and local government entities or agencies, (iv) compensation claims for damage to trees, railroad lines, or oil and gas equipment, or (v) other amounts that are not reasonably estimable.   Xcel Energy remains unable to reasonably estimate any additional loss or the upper end of the range because there are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability. In the event that SPS or Xcel Energy Services Inc. was found liable related to the litigation related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex and was required to pay damages, such amounts could exceed our insurance coverage of approximately $500 million for the annual policy period and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.   The process for estimating losses associated with potential claims related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors, including the factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires. As more information becomes available, management estimates and assumptions regarding the potential financial impact of the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex may change.   SPS records insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that recovery will occur, and SPS can reasonably estimate the amount or range. SPS has recorded an insurance receivable, net of recoveries received, for $210 million, presented within prepayments and other current assets as of Dec. 31, 2024. While SPS plans to seek recovery of all insured losses, it is unable to predict the ultimate amount and timing of such insurance recoveries.   Marshall Wildfire Litigation — In December 2021, a wildfire ignited in Boulder County, Colorado (Marshall Fire), which burned over 6,000 acres and destroyed or damaged over 1,000 structures. On June 8, 2023, the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office released its Marshall Fire Investigative Summary and Review and its supporting documents (Sheriff’s Report). According to an October 2022 statement from the Colorado Insurance Commissioner, the Marshall Fire is estimated to have caused more than $2 billion in property losses.   According to the Sheriff’s Report, on Dec. 30, 2021, a fire ignited on a residential property in Boulder, Colorado, located in PSCo’s service territory, for reasons unrelated to PSCo’s power lines. According to the Sheriff’s Report, approximately one hour and 20 minutes after the first ignition, a second fire ignited just south of the Marshall Mesa Trailhead in unincorporated Boulder County, Colorado, also located in PSCo’s service territory. According to the Sheriff’s Report, the second ignition started approximately 80 to 110 feet away from PSCo’s power lines in the area.   The Sheriff’s Report states that the most probable cause of the second ignition was hot particles discharged from PSCo’s power lines after one of the power lines detached from its insulator in strong winds, and further states that it cannot be ruled out that the second ignition was caused by an underground coal fire. According to the Sheriff’s Report, no design, installation or maintenance defects or deficiencies were identified on PSCo’s electrical circuit in the area of the second ignition. PSCo disputes that its power lines caused the second ignition.  PSCo is aware of 307 complaints, most of which have also named Xcel Energy Inc. and Xcel Energy Services Inc. as additional defendants, relating to the Marshall Fire. The complaints are on behalf of at least 4,087 plaintiffs. The complaints generally allege that PSCo’s equipment ignited the Marshall Fire and assert various causes of action under Colorado law, including negligence, premises liability, trespass, nuisance, wrongful death, willful and wanton conduct, negligent infliction of emotional distress, loss of consortium and inverse condemnation. In addition to seeking compensatory damages, certain of the complaints also seek exemplary damages.   In September 2023, the Boulder County District Court Judge consolidated the pending lawsuits into a single action for pretrial purposes and has subsequently consolidated additional lawsuits that have been filed. At the case management conference in February 2024, a trial date was set for September 2025. Discovery is now underway.   In September 2024, the Judge presiding over the consolidated cases in Boulder County issued an order regarding the trial that resolves, on a preliminary basis, certain disputes over the structure of the September 2025 trial. The Court ruled that all Plaintiffs should be bound by a trial on liability unless they opt-out with good cause. The Court also ruled that liability and damages should be largely or entirely tried separately, meaning that common questions of law and fact regarding liability would be decided first, and a majority or all of the damages phase will occur separately following the liability phase of trial. The individual plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the opt-out portion of this order, which the Court denied in November 2024, confirming that plaintiffs will have to demonstrate good cause in order to opt out of the trial. The Court also denied PSCo’s request for a change in venue, ruling that the trial will take place in Boulder County.   Colorado courts do not apply strict liability in determining an electric utility company’s liability for fire-related damages. For inverse condemnation claims, Colorado courts assess whether a defendant acted with intent to take a plaintiff’s property or intentionally took an action which has the natural consequence of taking the property. For negligence claims, Colorado courts look to whether electric power companies have operated their system with a heightened duty of care consistent with the practical conduct of its business, and liability does not extend to occurrences that cannot be reasonably anticipated.   Colorado law does not impose joint and several liability in tort actions. Instead, under Colorado law, a defendant is liable for the degree or percentage of the negligence or fault attributable to that defendant, except where the defendant conspired with another defendant. A jury’s verdict in a Colorado civil case must be unanimous. Under Colorado law, in a civil action filed before Jan. 1, 2025, other than a medical malpractice action, the total award for noneconomic loss is capped at $0.6 million per defendant unless the court finds justification to exceed that amount by clear and convincing evidence, in which case the maximum doubles.   Colorado law caps punitive or exemplary damages to an amount equal to the amount of the actual damages awarded to the injured party, except the court may increase any award of punitive damages to a sum up to three times the amount of actual damages if the conduct that is the subject of the claim has continued during the pendency of the case or the defendant has acted in a willful and wanton manner during the action which further aggravated plaintiff’s damages.   In the event Xcel Energy Inc. or PSCo was found liable related to this litigation and were required to pay damages, such amounts could exceed our insurance coverage of approximately $500 million and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, due to uncertainty as to the cause of the fire and the extent and magnitude of potential damages, Xcel Energy Inc. and PSCo are unable to estimate the amount or range of possible losses in connection with the Marshall Fire.   Note 6. Non-GAAP Reconciliation  Xcel Energy’s reported earnings are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Xcel Energy’s management believes that ongoing earnings, or GAAP earnings adjusted for certain items, reflect management’s performance in operating the company and provides a meaningful representation of the underlying performance of Xcel Energy’s core business. In addition, Xcel Energy’s management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, reporting of results to the Board of Directors and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.

Adjustments to GAAP net income include:   Sherco Unit 3 2011 Outage Refunds — NSP-Minnesota’s Sherco Unit 3 experienced an extended outage following a 2011 incident which damaged its turbine. In October 2024, following contested case procedures, the MPUC ordered a customer refund of $46 million for replacement power incurred during the outage.   Comanche Unit 3 Litigation — In the third quarter of 2023, PSCo recognized a non-recurring $34 million charge as a result of a jury verdict in Denver County District Court awarding CORE Electric Cooperative lost power damages and other costs.   Workforce Reduction — In 2023, Xcel Energy implemented workforce actions to align resources and investments with our evolving business and customer needs and streamline the organization for long-term success. Xcel Energy initiated a Voluntary Retirement Program, under which approximately 400 eligible non-bargaining employees retired. Xcel Energy also eliminated approximately 150 non-bargaining employees through an involuntary severance program. Workforce reduction expenses of $72 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023.   Note 7. Earnings Guidance and Long-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives  Xcel Energy 2025 Earnings Guidance — Xcel Energy’s 2025 ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share.(a)  Key assumptions as compared with 2024 actual levels unless noted:    Constructive outcomes in all pending rate case and regulatory proceedings, including requests for deferral of incremental insurance costs associated with wildfire risk and recovery of O&M costs associated with wildfire mitigation plans.    Normal weather patterns for the year.    Weather-normalized retail electric sales are projected to increase ~3%.    Weather-normalized retail firm natural gas sales are projected to increase ~1%.    Capital rider revenue is projected to increase $260 million to $270 million (net of PTCs).    O&M expenses are projected to increase ~3%.    Depreciation expense is projected to increase approximately $210 million to $220 million.    Property taxes are projected to increase $55 million to $65 million.    Interest expense (net of AFUDC - debt) is projected to increase $165 million to $175 million, net of interest income.    AFUDC - equity is projected to increase $110 million to $120 million.     (a)    Ongoing earnings is calculated using net income and adjusting for certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in management’s view, not reflective of ongoing operations. Ongoing earnings could differ from those prepared in accordance with GAAP for unplanned and/or unknown adjustments. As Xcel Energy is unable to quantify the financial impacts of any additional adjustments that may occur for the year, we are unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the guidance for ongoing EPS to corresponding GAAP EPS.

Additional information can be found at www.entegris.com.   Non-GAAP Information  The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Adjusted Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Segment Profit, Adjusted Operating Income, non-GAAP Net Income, non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Margin and diluted non-GAAP Earnings Per Common Share, together with related measures thereof, are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to better understand and manage its business and believes these measures provide investors and analysts additional and meaningful information for the assessment of the Company’s ongoing results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to assist in the evaluation of the performance of its business segments and to make operating decisions. Management believes that the Company’s non-GAAP measures help indicate the Company’s baseline performance before certain gains, losses or other charges that may not be indicative of the Company’s business or future outlook, and that non-GAAP measures offer a more consistent view of business performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures aid investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s results by providing a higher degree of transparency for such items and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors generally understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company’s business performance. Management believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides greater consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the Company’s historical operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. The reconciliations of GAAP net sales to Adjusted Net Sales (excluding divestitures), GAAP gross profit to Adjusted Gross Profit, GAAP segment profit to Adjusted Operating Income, GAAP net income to Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA, GAAP net income and diluted earnings per common share to non-GAAP Net Income and diluted non-GAAP Earnings Per Common Share and GAAP outlook to non-GAAP outlook are included elsewhere in this release.

Lincoln Financial Reports 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206071156/en/Lincoln-Financial-Reports-2024-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results,2025-02-06 11:30:00," RADNOR, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lincoln Financial (NYSE: LNC) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024.    Fourth quarter net income available to common stockholders was $1.7 billion, or $9.63 per diluted share.    Fourth quarter adjusted operating income available to common stockholders was $332 million, or $1.91 per diluted share.    The primary differences between net income and adjusted operating income resulted from the following factors:   $1.2 billion of the pre-tax net income, or $6.83 per diluted share, was primarily due to changes in market risk benefits driven by the increase in interest rates, a non-economic impact.    $587 million of the pre-tax net income, or $3.37 per diluted share, was primarily driven by a change in the fair value of an embedded derivative related to the Fortitude Re reinsurance transaction, with a direct offset in other comprehensive income (loss).      Lincoln's estimated risk-based capital (""RBC"") ratio was in excess of 430% at year end.    ""We achieved strong results in the fourth quarter of 2024, capping a year that demonstrated our continued momentum to build a solid capital foundation, increase operational efficiency, and deliver profitable growth,"" said Ellen Cooper, Chairman, President and CEO of Lincoln Financial. ""Our accelerated pace was led by Group Protection which reported a record fourth quarter and full year for sales, earnings, and margin. Annuities generated robust earnings growth for the same reporting periods, with a diversified product mix supporting its highest full-year sales in five years. We refocused our Life business to emphasize more risk-sharing products, and our Retirement business saw full-year total deposit growth of 25%, driving its tenth consecutive year of positive flows.   The strength of our broad-based execution sets the stage for future success in positioning Lincoln for sustained long-term value creation as we further leverage our competitive advantages, including our powerful franchise, distribution leadership, broad product portfolio, and trusted brand.”   Business Highlights  Our 2024 fourth-quarter and full-year results were driven by the substantial progress of each of our businesses in executing their strategic priorities.   Retail Solutions   Annuities reported operating income of $303 million, 14% higher than the 2023 fourth quarter (excluding the impact of a fourth quarter 2023 model refinement), driven by account balance growth due to strong markets and higher spread income. Fourth-quarter sales were $3.7 billion, rounding out a strong year in which sales increased 7% compared to the prior year and reached the highest level since 2019. The strength of this result was attributable to a diversified product mix that addressed a range of customer preferences, with spread-based products comprising approximately two-thirds of sales.     Life Insurance reported an operating loss of $15 million, compared to an operating loss of $6 million in the prior-year quarter. The loss was due to unfavorable mortality primarily driven by higher-than-expected severity, partially offset by higher alternative investment income and lower net G&A expenses. Total sales were $119 million, essentially unchanged sequentially. We continue to focus on growth in accumulation and protection products with more risk sharing, which are expected to generate more stable cash flows and higher risk-adjusted returns over time.    Workplace Solutions   Group Protection reported operating income of $107 million in the quarter, which more than doubled year over year, and its margin expanded to 8.4%, increasing 430 basis points for the same period. Group generated record sales and earnings for the full year , resulting in nearly 300 basis points of margin expansion year over year (excluding the impact of the annual assumption review in both periods). This outcome was driven by continued favorable long-term disability results, improved mortality, and strong operational execution. Premiums increased by 3% for the same period, reflecting ongoing pricing discipline on new sales and renewals.     Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $43 million in the quarter, up 13% year over year, due to higher account balances and lower net G&A expenses. First-year sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter, 46% higher than the prior-year period, and full-year total deposits increased 25% compared to 2023 as our differentiated service model and product innovation continued to resonate within the market. Additionally, net inflows were positive for a tenth consecutive year.

Income from operations was $303 million for the fourth quarter, a 14% increase compared to the prior-year quarter (excluding the impact of a $14 million fourth-quarter 2023 model refinement). This increase was primarily due to favorable equity markets and higher spread income.    Total sales were $3.7 billion in the quarter, capping a strong year in which sales increased 7% compared to the prior year.    Net outflows were approximately $1.9 billion in the quarter, compared to net inflows of $285 million in the prior-year quarter, due to the effect of higher interest rates and strong equity markets.    Average account balances, net of reinsurance, were $160 billion for the full year, increasing 8% year over year. This result was primarily due to growth in RILA, driven by strong sales momentum throughout 2024. RILA represented 21% of total annuity ending account balances, net of reinsurance, a 3 percentage point increase year over year.

This increase was driven by unfavorable mortality primarily due to higher-than-expected severity, partially offset by higher alternative investment income and lower net G&A expenses.    Total sales were $119 million, essentially unchanged sequentially. We remain focused on growing our presence in accumulation and protection products with more risk-sharing, which are expected to generate more stable cash flows and higher risk-adjusted returns over time.    Average account balances, net of reinsurance, were $45 billion, relatively flat versus the prior-year quarter.

Income from operations was $107 million in the quarter, more than doubling compared to the prior-year quarter. The margin was 8.4%, increasing 430 basis points for the same period. These results were driven by continued favorable long-term disability results, improved mortality trends, and strong operational execution.    Sales increased 17% year over year with growth across all product categories.    The total loss ratio was 71.0%, 560 basis points lower than the prior-year quarter. This result was due to the same factors that drove Group's margin improvement.    Insurance premiums were $1.3 billion in the quarter, increasing 2% as we continued to maintain pricing discipline.

This result was primarily due to higher account balances and lower net G&A expenses.    Total deposits for the quarter were $3.5 billion, 17% higher than the prior-year quarter, as our differentiated service model and product innovation continued to resonate in the market.    Net outflows totaled $732 million for the quarter, driven by seasonally higher terminations, partially offset by continued strength in first-year sales. Net inflows for 2024 full year were $112 million, representing ten consecutive years of positive net flows.    Average account balances for the quarter were $114 billion, increasing 18% from the prior year.

See Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures at the back of this press release.       (3) Income (loss) from operations does not include preferred dividends.      Unrealized Gains and Losses  The Company reported a net unrealized loss of $10.3 billion (pre-tax) on its available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2024. This compared to a net unrealized loss of $8.7 billion (pre-tax) as of December 31, 2023, with the year-over-year increase primarily due to higher Treasury rates.   The tables attached to this release define and reconcile the non-GAAP measures adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted income (loss) from operations available to common stockholders, book value per share, excluding AOCI, and adjusted book value per share to net income (loss), net income (loss) available to common stockholders, and book value per share, including AOCI, calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Non-GAAP Measures  Management believes that adjusted income (loss) from operations (or adjusted operating income), adjusted income (loss) from operations available to common stockholders, and adjusted income (loss) from operations per diluted share available to common stockholders better explain the results of the company’s ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in the company’s current business as the excluded items are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in most instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. Management also believes that using book value, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), and adjusted book value per share enables investors to analyze the amount of our net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations. Book value per share, excluding AOCI is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates. Adjusted book value per share is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in equity markets and interest rates.   For the historical periods, reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure may be included in this Appendix to the press release and/or are included in the Statistical Supplements for the corresponding periods contained in the Earnings section of the Investor Relations page on our website: http://www.lincolnfinancial.com/investor.   Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures Used in this Press Release  Adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted income (loss) from operations available to common stockholders, book value per share, excluding AOCI, and adjusted book value per share are financial measures we use to evaluate and assess our results. Adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted income (loss) from operations available to common stockholders, book value per share, excluding AOCI, and adjusted book value per share, as used in the press release, are non-GAAP financial measures and do not replace GAAP net income (loss), net income (loss) available to common stockholders, and book value per share, including AOCI, the most directly comparable GAAP measures.   Adjusted Income (Loss) from Operations  In the third quarter of 2024, we revised our definition of adjusted income (loss) from operations to exclude the impact of certain additional items that are not indicative of the ongoing operations of the business and may obscure trends in the underlying performance of the Company. The presentation of prior period adjusted income (loss) from operations was recast for such third quarter 2024 revisions to conform to the current period presentation.   Adjusted income (loss) from operations is GAAP net income excluding the following items, as applicable:    Items related to annuity product features, which include changes in MRBs, including gains and losses and benefit payments, changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments we hold to hedge GLB and GDB riders, net of fee income allocated to support the cost of hedging them, and changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our indexed annuity contracts and the associated index options we hold to hedge them, including collateral expense associated with the hedge program (collectively, “net annuity product features”);    Items related to life insurance product features, which include changes in the fair value of derivatives we hold as part of VUL hedging, changes in reserves resulting from benefit ratio unlocking associated with the impact of capital markets, and changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities of our IUL contracts and the associated index options we hold to hedge them (collectively, “net life insurance product features”);    Credit loss-related adjustments on fixed maturity AFS securities, mortgage loans on real estate and reinsurance-related assets (“credit loss-related adjustments”);    Changes in the fair value of equity securities, certain derivatives, certain other investments and realized gains (losses) on sales, disposals and impairments of financial assets (collectively, “investment gains (losses)”);    Changes in the fair value of reinsurance-related embedded derivatives, trading securities and mortgage loans on real estate electing the fair value option (“changes in the fair value of reinsurance-related embedded derivatives, trading securities and certain mortgage loans”);    Income (loss) from the initial adoption of new accounting standards, accounting policy changes and new regulations, including changes in tax law;    Income (loss) from reserve changes, net of related amortization, on business sold through reinsurance;    Losses from the impairment of intangible assets and gains (losses) on other non-financial assets;    Income (loss) from discontinued operations;    Other items, which include the following: certain legal and regulatory accruals; severance expense related to initiatives that realign the workforce; transaction and integration costs related to mergers and acquisitions including the acquisition or divestiture, through reinsurance or other means, of businesses or blocks of business; mark-to-market adjustment related to the LNC stock component of our deferred compensation plans (“deferred compensation mark-to-market adjustment”); gains (losses) on modification or early extinguishment of debt; and impacts from settlement or curtailment of defined benefit obligations; and    Income tax benefit (expense) related to the above pre-tax items, including the effect of tax adjustments such as changes to deferred tax valuation allowances.    Adjusted Income (Loss) from Operations Available to Common Stockholders  Adjusted income (loss) from operations available to common stockholders is defined as after-tax adjusted income (loss) from operations less preferred stock dividends.   Book Value Per Share, Excluding AOCI  Book value per share, excluding AOCI, is calculated based upon a non-GAAP financial measure.    It is calculated by dividing (a) stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and preferred stock, by (b) common shares outstanding.    We provide book value per share, excluding AOCI, to enable investors to analyze the amount of our net worth that is attributable primarily to our business operations.    Management believes book value per share, excluding AOCI, is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates.    Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.    Adjusted Book Value Per Share  Adjusted book value per share is calculated based upon a non-GAAP financial measure.    It is calculated by dividing (a) stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, preferred stock, MRB-related impacts, GLB and GLB hedge instrument gains (losses), and the difference between amounts recognized in net income (loss) on reinsurance-related embedded derivatives and the underlying asset portfolios (“reinsurance-related embedded derivatives and portfolio gains (losses)”) by (b) common shares outstanding.    We provide adjusted book value per share to enable investors to analyze the amount of our net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations.    Management believes adjusted book value per share is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of market movements that are unpredictable that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in equity markets and interest rates.    Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.    Other Definitions  Holding Company Available Liquidity  Holding company available liquidity consists of cash and invested cash, excluding cash held as collateral, and certain short-term investments that can be readily converted into cash, net of commercial paper outstanding.   Sales  Sales as reported consist of the following:    Annuities and Retirement Plan Services – deposits from new and existing customers;    Universal life insurance (“UL”), indexed universal life insurance (“IUL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”) – first-year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premiums received;    MoneyGuard® linked-benefit products – MoneyGuard® (UL), 15% of total expected premium deposits, and MoneyGuard Market AdvantageSM (VUL), 150% of commissionable premiums;    Executive Benefits – insurance and corporate-owned UL and VUL, first-year commissionable premiums plus 5% of excess premium received, and single premium bank-owned UL and VUL, 15% of single premium deposits;    Term – 100% of annualized first-year premiums; and    Group Protection – annualized first-year premiums from new policies.

(2)      Includes intent to sell impairments during the second and third quarters of 2023 of certain fixed maturity AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, resulting from the Company’s intent to sell these securities as part of the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction.       (3)      Includes primarily changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative related to the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction.       (4)      Relates to the sale of our wealth management business, which provided approximately $650 million of statutory capital benefit.       (5)      For the fourth quarter of 2024, includes certain legal accruals of $(15) million and regulatory accruals of $(12) million related to estimated state guaranty fund assessments net of estimated state premium tax recoveries; for the year ended 2024, includes certain legal accruals of $(129) million, primarily attributable to a first quarter 2024 accrual related to the settlement of cost of insurance litigation, and regulatory accruals of $(12) million; for the year ended 2023, includes certain legal accruals of $(12) million.       (6)      Includes severance expense related to initiatives to realign the workforce of $(2) million in the fourth quarter of 2024, and $(74) million and $(7) million for the years ended 2024 and 2023, respectively.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS – CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE  Certain statements made in this press release and in other written or oral statements made by Lincoln or on Lincoln’s behalf are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements. Forward-looking statements may contain words like: “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “shall,” “will” and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in Lincoln’s businesses, prospective services or products, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. Lincoln claims the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.   Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including:    Weak general economic and business conditions that may affect demand for our products, account balances, investment results, guaranteed benefit liabilities, premium levels and claims experience;    Adverse global capital and credit market conditions that may affect our ability to raise capital, if necessary, and may cause us to realize impairments on investments and certain intangible assets, including goodwill and the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which may reduce future earnings and/or affect our financial condition and ability to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt as it matures;    The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company in sufficient amounts, which could harm the holding company’s ability to meet its obligations;    Legislative, regulatory or tax changes, both domestic and foreign, that affect: the cost of, or demand for, our subsidiaries’ products; the required amount of reserves and/or surplus; our ability to conduct business; our affiliate reinsurance arrangements; and restrictions on the payment of revenue sharing and 12b-1 distribution fees;    Changes in tax law or the interpretation of or application of existing tax laws that could impact our tax costs and the products that we sell;    The impact of regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Department of Labor or other federal or state regulators or self-regulatory organizations that could adversely affect our distribution model and sales of our products and result in additional disclosure and other requirements related to the sale and delivery of our products;    The impact of new and emerging rules, laws and regulations relating to privacy, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence that may lead to increased compliance costs, reputation risk and/or changes in business practices;    Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations and regulations regarding ESG matters that may adversely affect our reputation and our investment portfolio;    Actions taken by reinsurers to raise rates on in-force business;    Declines in or sustained low interest rates causing a reduction in investment income, the interest margins of our businesses and demand for our products;    Rapidly increasing or sustained high interest rates that may negatively affect our profitability, value of our investment portfolio and capital position and may cause policyholders to surrender annuity and life insurance policies, thereby causing realized investment losses;    The impact of the implementation of the provisions of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation relating to the regulation of derivatives transactions;    The initiation of legal or regulatory proceedings against us, and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings, such as: adverse actions related to present or past business practices common in businesses in which we compete; adverse decisions in significant actions including, but not limited to, actions brought by federal and state authorities and class action cases; new decisions that result in changes in law; and unexpected trial court rulings;    A decline or continued volatility in the equity markets causing a reduction in the sales of our subsidiaries’ products; a reduction of asset-based fees that our subsidiaries charge on various investment and insurance products; and an increase in liabilities related to guaranteed benefit riders, which are accounted for as market risk benefits, of our subsidiaries’ variable annuity products;    Ineffectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures, including our various hedging strategies;    A deviation in actual experience regarding future policyholder behavior, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from the assumptions used in pricing our subsidiaries’ products and in establishing related insurance reserves, which may reduce future earnings;    Changes in accounting principles that may affect our consolidated financial statements;    Lowering of one or more of our debt ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations and the adverse effect such action may have on our ability to raise capital and on our liquidity and financial condition;    Lowering of one or more of the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the adverse effect such action may have on the premium writings, policy retention, profitability of our insurance subsidiaries and liquidity;    Significant credit, accounting, fraud, corporate governance or other issues that may adversely affect the value of certain financial assets, as well as counterparties to which we are exposed to credit risk, requiring that we realize losses on financial assets;    Interruption in or failure of the telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems of the company or the third parties on whom we rely or failure to safeguard the confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems, including from cyberattacks or other breaches in security of such systems;    The effect of acquisitions and divestitures, including the inability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and potential operating difficulties and unforeseen liabilities relating thereto, as well as the effect of restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual items;    The inability to realize or sustain the benefits we expect from, greater than expected investments in, and the potential impact of efforts related to, our strategic initiatives;    The adequacy and collectability of reinsurance that we have obtained;    Pandemics, acts of terrorism, war or other man-made and natural catastrophes that may adversely impact liabilities for policyholder claims, affect our businesses and increase the cost and availability of reinsurance;    Competitive conditions, including pricing pressures, new product offerings and the emergence of new competitors, that may affect the level of premiums and fees that our subsidiaries can charge for their products;    The unknown effect on our subsidiaries’ businesses resulting from evolving market preferences and the changing demographics of our client base; and    The unanticipated loss of key management or wholesalers.    The risks and uncertainties included here are not exhaustive. Our most recent Form 10-K, as well as other reports that we file with the SEC, include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.   Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, Lincoln disclaims any obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this press release.

Tradeweb Reports January 2025 Total Trading Volume of $54.6 Trillion and Average Daily Volume of $2.44 Trillion,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206392849/en/Tradeweb-Reports-January-2025-Total-Trading-Volume-of-54.6-Trillion-and-Average-Daily-Volume%C2%A0of-2.44-Trillion,2025-02-06 11:30:00," NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported total trading volume for the month of January 2025 of $54.6 trillion (tn)1. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was $2.44tn, an increase of 20.3 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY). Excluding the impact of the ICD acquisition, which closed on August 1, 2024, total ADV for the month of January was up 6.4% YoY.   In January 2025, Tradeweb records included:    ADV in European government bonds    ADV in mortgages    ADV in global repurchase agreements    ADV in equity convertibles/swaps/options    January 2025 Highlights  RATES   U.S. government bond ADV was up 14.3% YoY to $232.1 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 16.5% YoY to $58.4bn.   U.S. and European government bond activity remained strong in January. U.S. Treasuries growth was led by robust activity across the institutional and wholesale client channels, while record European government bond ADV was driven by strong volumes across our institutional client channel. A diverse set of clients continued to trade on the platform, with growing adoption across a wide range of trading protocols.      Mortgage ADV was up 21.1% YoY to $265.7bn.   Record To-Be-Announced (TBA) activity was primarily driven by an increase in dollar-roll activity YoY. Tradeweb’s specified pool platform reported strong volumes, an increase of 44% YoY, driven by a record number of clients executing on the platform, surpassing the previous December 2024 record.      Swaps/swaptions ≥ 1-year ADV was down 25.7% YoY to $439.2bn and total rates derivatives ADV was down 15.9% YoY to $779.8bn.   Swaps/swaptions ≥ 1-year activity was lower YoY due to a 52% YoY decline in compression activity, which carries a relatively lower fee per million. January compression activity as a percentage of swaps/swaptions ≥ 1-year is trending higher than 4Q24. Strong risk trading volume in swaps/swaptions ≥ 1-year was driven by macroeconomic data and corporate issuance in the market.      CREDIT   Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 5.0% YoY to $7.5bn and European credit ADV was down 3.9% YoY to $2.4bn.   U.S. credit volumes were driven by increased client adoption of Tradeweb protocols, most notably request-for-quote (RFQ). Tradeweb captured 17.5% and 7.7% of fully electronic U.S high grade and U.S. high yield TRACE, respectively, as measured by Tradeweb. Heightened market volatility weighed on European credit volumes, primarily impacting Tradeweb’s European wholesale business. However, platform volumes improved throughout the month as client adoption of Tradeweb’s Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) tool, RFQ, portfolio trading and Tradeweb AllTrade® picked up.      Municipal bonds ADV was up 26.2% YoY to $407 million (mm).   Municipal bonds volumes saw growth across the retail and institutional platforms, outpacing the broader market, which was up approximately 4.8% YoY2.      Credit derivatives ADV was up 60.2% YoY to $15.5bn.   Increased hedge fund and systematic account activity, along with heightened credit volatility, led to increased swap execution facility (SEF) and multilateral trading facility (MTF) credit default swaps activity.      EQUITIES   U.S. ETF ADV was down 15.7% YoY to $8.5bn and European ETF ADV was up 24.5% YoY to $3.2bn.   European ETF volumes increased YoY as more clients embraced our automated rules-based RFQ. U.S. ETF volumes were lower YoY primarily due to reduced secondary volumes in the market, which disproportionally impacted our U.S. ETF wholesale business.      MONEY MARKETS   Repo ADV was up 33.8% YoY to $730.9bn.   Record global repo trading activity was supported by increased client participation across the platform. In the U.S., volumes were driven by the continued unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet and reduced balances in the reverse repo facility (RRP). In Europe, strong activity was driven by increased balances and heightened roll activity, despite a volatile market.      Other Money Markets ADV was up YoY to $302.7bn.   Other money markets volume growth was driven by the inclusion of ICD volumes in January 2025.

In determining the reported U.S. dollar amounts for non-U.S. dollar denominated securities, the non-U.S. dollar amount for a particular month is translated into U.S. dollars generally based on the monthly average foreign exchange rate for the prior month. Volumes presented in this release exclude volumes generated by (i) unbilled trial agreements, (ii) products billed on an agreement basis where we do not calculate notional value, and (iii) products that are not rates, credit, equities or money markets products. Please see the footnotes on page 3 of the full report for information regarding how we calculate market share amounts presented in this release.   Beginning with the publication of the December 2024 Monthly Activity Report, Tradeweb adjusted its methodology for reflecting acquisitions in its reported average daily volume figures. For average daily volume derived from acquisitions, the denominator is now the number of trading days that have elapsed from the acquisition date to the end date of the reporting period, and not the total number of trading days in the reporting period, which was the previous methodology. Beginning in December 2024, this methodology was applied retroactively to restate the impact of both 2024 acquisitions; the average daily volume attributable to acquisitions occurring prior to 2024 was not restated.

New Research Reveals Organizations Prioritize Hybrid Communications Systems to Combat Complexity and Improve Resilience,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206404969/en/New-Research-Reveals-Organizations-Prioritize-Hybrid-Communications-Systems-to-Combat-Complexity-and-Improve-Resilience,2025-02-06 11:30:00," SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mitel, a global leader in business communications, today announced the findings of a new survey conducted by analyst research firm Techaisle, which uncovered organizations’ communication trends and challenges. The findings point to a pivotal shift in mid-market and enterprise communications strategies, with an overwhelming 92% of respondents prioritizing a hybrid communications model that ensures flexibility to deliver a consistent communications and collaboration experience across their organizations. The research is based on interviews with business and IT decision-makers in the US, UK, France, and Germany.     Hybrid communication models combine new and existing on-premise with private and public cloud platforms, enabling improved efficiency, control, resilience, compliance, and an AI-enabled user experience. This allows organizations to seamlessly integrate multiple tools and deployment models, enabling the efficient exchange of information and providing a consistent front-end experience for users and customers.   Techaisle’s data shows the market agrees, with 68% of organizations saying they are adopting hybrid solutions to enhance collaboration between remote and in-office teams. Other factors include ensuring data security and control over sensitive information (57%), adapting to changing business needs (53%), and maximizing investments in existing technologies (45%).   Beyond the growing demand for hybrid solutions, the research further reinforces the emerging belief that modernizing communications tools goes beyond merely upgrading technology. Organization leaders now see it as an integral part of adapting to a changing environment, enhancing customer experiences, improving operational efficiency, and leveraging the power of AI to achieve strategic goals.   Those surveyed said they prioritize AI-powered capabilities (53%) and video collaboration (98%) when selecting a communication solutions provider. Half (50%) also said data control and security were critical elements, which supports a strong market focus on maintaining business continuity and mitigating security risk.   “After racing to adopt multi-tenant cloud solutions, many organizations face increasing complexity from evolving security requirements, compliance mandates, and the integration of advanced technologies like GenAI. Customers struggle with systems that hinder their ability to balance risks at scale and avoid business disruption,” said Luiz Domingos, Chief Technology Officer at Mitel. “The findings from the report confirm these challenges and show a desire from IT teams and business leaders to modernize and focus on hybrid communications systems to connect priorities: security, compliance, customer engagement, and employee experience – all of which contribute to business resilience.”   Other key findings from the report include:    Too many organizations rely on outdated systems: 68% of finance, government, and healthcare respondents have relied on their current communications system for more than seven years. This is hindering digital transformation, increasing risk, and preventing the seamless use of AI-led innovation.    Customer engagement is a primary driver of modernization: Improving customer interaction quality is driving firms to modernize outdated systems and workflows. 52% of respondents are focused on enhancing customer engagement by upgrading communication solutions and delivering customer-centric experiences.    Modernization can help consolidate disparate systems and scale operations: 41% of organizations are looking to simplify their fragmented communication systems and improve data visibility by unifying their tools under one single platform. Segmented tools used today are hard to manage and are creating disparate systems leading to data silos that disrupt workflows.    Communications solutions are entering the AI era: As hybrid models emerge as the preferred approach, an effective modernization strategy must incorporate AI-powered solutions. These solutions are fueled by the newly released more efficient large and small language models that are ideal for a hybrid delivery model to balance performance, efficiency, and cost while unlocking the full potential of digital transformation. Manufacturing (59%) and hospitality (59%) are the leading industries looking to invest in AI-powered solutions to extend communications and collaboration capabilities, both from the cloud and through the power of Edge computing.    “Today's complex digital landscape presents organizations with many challenges, from security and regulatory compliance to evolving customer expectations and the complexities of hybrid work,"" said Anurag Agrawal, Chief Global Analyst at Techaisle. ""These challenges directly impact how organizations communicate, driving a strong consensus around the need for hybrid communications systems. A strong foundation for these systems is crucial for realizing the full potential of modern, flexible, and AI-driven technologies. Mitel is strategically positioned to lead this market, offering UC solutions with robust integration and professional services, AI-powered innovation, advanced security, and support for diverse workforces.”   To learn more about the findings, please download the full report “The Hybrid and AI Revolution in Business Communications: What it Means for You”.

The survey targeted business decision-makers (BDMs) and IT decision-makers (ITDMs) involved in all stages of the purchasing process, including needs identification, feature determination, solution evaluation, and deployment of communication and contact center solutions.

HILTON WORLDWIDE HOLDINGS INC. DEFINITIONS  Net Income (Loss), Adjusted for Special Items, and Diluted EPS, Adjusted for Special Items  Net income (loss), adjusted for special items is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Hilton stockholders, as reported, plus total special items after taxes. Net income (loss), adjusted for special items, and diluted earnings (loss) per share (""EPS""), adjusted for special items, are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), diluted EPS or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our definition of net income (loss), adjusted for special items, and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.   Net income (loss), adjusted for special items, and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, are included to assist investors in performing meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and as a means of highlighting the results of our ongoing operations.   EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Net Income (Loss) Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin  EBITDA reflects net income (loss), excluding interest expense, a provision for income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including gains, losses, revenues and expenses in connection with: (i) asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated investments; (ii) foreign currency transactions; (iii) debt restructurings and retirements; (iv) furniture, fixtures and equipment (""FF&E"") replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements; (v) share-based compensation; (vi) reorganization, severance, relocation and other expenses; (vii) non-cash impairment; (viii) amortization of contract acquisition costs; (ix) other revenues from managed and franchised properties and other expenses from managed and franchised properties; and (x) other items.   Net income (loss) margin represents net income (loss) as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues, adjusted to exclude the amortization of contract acquisition costs and other revenues from managed and franchised properties.   We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions and (ii) these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. Additionally, these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry. For instance, interest expense and income taxes are dependent on company specifics, including, among other things, capital structure and operating jurisdictions, respectively, and, therefore, could vary significantly across companies. Depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as amortization of contract acquisition costs, are dependent upon company policies, including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are assigned to those depreciating or amortizing assets for accounting purposes. For Adjusted EBITDA, we also exclude items such as: (i) FF&E replacement reserves for leased hotels to be consistent with the treatment of capital expenditures for property and equipment, where depreciation of such capitalized assets is reported within depreciation and amortization expenses; (ii) share-based compensation, as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them; and (iii) other items that are not reflective of our operating performance, such as amounts related to debt restructurings and debt retirements and reorganization and related severance costs, to enhance period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing operations. Further, Adjusted EBITDA excludes both other revenues from managed and franchised properties and other expenses from managed and franchised properties as we contractually do not operate the related programs to generate a profit and have the contractual rights to adjust future collections to recover prior period expenditures. The direct reimbursements from property owners are billable and reimbursable as the costs are incurred and have no net effect on net income (loss) in the reporting period. The indirect reimbursements from property owners are typically billed and collected monthly, based on the underlying hotel's sales or usage (e.g., gross room revenue or number of reservations processed), while the associated costs are recognized as incurred by Hilton, creating timing differences, with the net effect impacting net income (loss) in the reporting period. These timing differences are due to our discretion to spend in excess of revenues earned or less than revenues earned in a single period to ensure that the programs are operated in the best long-term interests of our property owners. However, over the life of the operation of these programs, the expenses incurred related to the indirect reimbursements are designed to equal the revenues earned from the indirect reimbursements over time such that, in the long term, the programs will not earn a profit or generate a loss and do not impact our economics, either positively or negatively. Therefore, the net effect of our cost reimbursement revenues and expenses is not used by management to evaluate our operating performance, determine executive compensation or make other operating decisions, and we exclude their impact when evaluating period over period performance results.   EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives, either in isolation or as a substitute, for net income (loss), net income (loss) margin or other measures of financial performance or liquidity, including cash flows, derived in accordance with GAAP. Further, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered as other methods of analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.   Net Debt, Long-Term Debt to Net Income Ratio and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio  Long-term debt to net income ratio is calculated as the ratio of Hilton's long-term debt, including current maturities, to net income. Net debt is calculated as: long-term debt, including current maturities and excluding the deduction for unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts; reduced by: (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) restricted cash and cash equivalents. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated as the ratio of Hilton's net debt to Adjusted EBITDA. Net debt and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, presented herein, are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company uses to evaluate its financial leverage.   Net debt should not be considered as a substitute to debt presented in accordance with GAAP, and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio should not be considered as an alternative to measures of financial condition derived in accordance with GAAP. Net debt and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe net debt and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio provide useful information about our indebtedness to investors as they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to compare the indebtedness between companies.   Comparable Hotels  We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year, have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods and were open January 1st of the previous year; and (ii) have not undergone large-scale capital projects, sustained substantial property damage, encountered business interruption or for which comparable results were not available. We exclude strategic partner hotels from our comparable hotels. Of the 8,342 hotels in our system as of December 31, 2024, 409 hotels were strategic partner hotels and 6,050 hotels were classified as comparable hotels. Our 1,883 non-comparable hotels as of December 31, 2024 included (i) 1,005 hotels that were added to our system after January 1, 2023 or that have undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported and (ii) 878 hotels that were removed from the comparable group for the current or comparable periods reported because they underwent or are undergoing large-scale capital projects, sustained substantial property damage, encountered business interruption or comparable results were otherwise not available.   Occupancy  Occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period. Occupancy measures the utilization of available capacity at a hotel or group of hotels. Management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. Occupancy levels also help management determine achievable Average Daily Rate (""ADR"") pricing levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases.   ADR  ADR represents hotel room revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold for a given period. ADR measures the average room price attained by a hotel, and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in the industry, and we use ADR to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer, as changes in rates charged to customers have different effects on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above.   Revenue per Available Room (""RevPAR"")  RevPAR is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period. We consider RevPAR to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels, as previously described: occupancy and ADR. RevPAR is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels.   References to occupancy, ADR and RevPAR are presented on a comparable basis, based on the comparable hotels as of December 31, 2024, and references to ADR and RevPAR are presented on a currency neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. As such, comparisons of these hotel operating statistics for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 use the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of the Company's foreign operations within its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.   Pipeline  Rooms under construction include rooms for hotels under construction or operating hotels that are in the process of conversion to our system.  "

Piraeus Agrees to Enter Into Exclusive Discussions With CVC Regarding the Acquisition of Ethniki Insurance,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206983174/en/Piraeus-Agrees-to-Enter-Into-Exclusive-Discussions-With-CVC-Regarding-the-Acquisition-of-Ethniki-Insurance,2025-02-06 10:42:00," ATHENS, Greece--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Further to the announcement on 03 February 2025, Piraeus Financial Holdings (hereinafter “Piraeus”) informs the investment community that it has agreed to enter into exclusive discussions with CVC Capital Partners' Fund VII (“CVC”) regarding the potential acquisition by Piraeus of a 70% stake in Ethniki Insurance for €469mn (the “Potential Transaction”).   Post the completion of the Potential Transaction, Piraeus expects to diversify and further strengthen its revenue pool and to deliver significant value uplift to its shareholders.   Based on the above, the proforma impact on Piraeus’ capital position is estimated at approximately 150bps as at September 2024. This impact translates into a capital ratio with a comfortable Pillar 2 Guidance buffer of more than 200bps. Piraeus intends to pursue the potential adoption of the Danish Compromise in relation to the prudential treatment of its possible participation in the share capital of Ethniki Insurance, which, if attained, would reduce the capital effect of the Potential Transaction to below 100bps.   Ethniki Insurance is the #1 composite insurer in Greece, covering the whole spectrum of insurance products with a c.14% market share (c.17% in life / c.11% in non-life) and €0.8bn Gross Written Premiums, as of 2023. Ethniki Insurance has €4bn total assets and €0.4bn shareholders’ equity, as of 2023. Ethniki Insurance reported a profit before tax adjusted for non-recurring items of approximately €100mn in 2023.   Ethniki Insurance's production network extends throughout Greece and consists of c.130 Sales Network Offices with more than 1.6k Corporate Network Insurance Agents, 1.1k Collaborating Insurance Agencies and c.135 Collaborating Insurance Brokers, supported by a network of 6 branches, as of 2023.   Piraeus is being advised on the Potential Transaction by UBS Europe SE as exclusive financial advisor, Milliman as actuarial advisor, and by Milbank LLP, as well as Moratis Passas Law Firm, as international and local legal counsels, respectively.   Piraeus will promptly inform the investment community in accordance with the applicable provisions should an additional reportable event arise.   Disclaimer  Forward looking statements  This release contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the potential benefits of the contemplated transaction, expected synergies and the anticipated capital impact. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of Piraeus and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the granting of regulatory approvals, to unforeseen operational challenges or changes in market conditions.

FICO UK Credit Card Market Report: November/December 2024,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206421912/en/FICO-UK-Credit-Card-Market-Report-NovemberDecember-2024,2025-02-06 09:30:00," LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spending, balances, payments, and cash usage on UK credit cards followed expected seasonal trends in November and December 2024, with spending and balances reaching the highest averages that global analytics software provider FICO has ever recorded. While missed payments fell in November and December, average balances rose on accounts where payments have been missed.   Highlights   Average credit card spend rose in the lead-up to Christmas 2024, reaching £860 in December; a 6.8% increase on November and a 1.5% increase on December 2023    December saw the highest average balance since FICO records began in 2006 at £1,860 - 4.5% higher than December 2023    The percentage of overall balance paid fell by 3% in November compared to October and by a further 0.5% in December, with 35.86% of the balance being paid off in December 2024    Fewer customers missed payments in November and December 2024 than across the same two months in 2023    Customers using their credit card to withdraw cash fell for the third month in a row, standing at 3.19% in December 2024    Average spending saw typical seasonal increases in the run-up to Christmas. However, with average spend reaching £860 in December – a 6.8% increase on November and the highest since FICO records began in 2006 – the ongoing impact of continued inflation could dent consumer affordability through 2025.   Similarly, average credit card balances reached an all-time high in December at £1,860, with typical seasonal pressures seeing a 3% month-on-month decrease in the percentage of balance paid in November and a further 0.5% drop in December. If seasonal patterns continue, the balance paid is expected to rise in January as consumers focus on paying off Christmas spend.   For customers missing one, two or three payments, the average balance increased year-on-year in November and December – another indicator of the financial pressures faced throughout 2024. Average balances for one missed payment are now £2,255, for two payments £2,780 and for three payments £3,190.   The usual seasonal trend sees a reduction in customers missing one payment in the run-up to Christmas, as people want to keep lines of credit open. However, in December 2024 there was a 9.3% increase compared to November. And after four consecutive decreases in the percentage of customers missing three payments, there was a 1.2% increase in November month-on-month and a further 2.2% increase in December. As indebted customers struggle with payments in the new year, this trend is expected to continue in early 2025.   Given the continued financial pressures affecting households, risk managers should review both limit management and collections contact strategies in order to help customers avoid getting into long-term debt.   These card performance figures are part of the data shared with subscribers of the FICO® Benchmark Reporting Service. The data sample comes from client reports generated by the FICO® TRIAD® Customer Manager solution in use by some 80% of UK card issuers. For more information on these trends, contact FICO.   About FICO  FICO (NYSE: FICO) powers decisions that help people and businesses around the world prosper.

"Northern Trust Forecasts Moderate Global Equity Returns, Solid High Yield Bond Performance and Strength in Private Credit",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206595195/en/Northern-Trust-Forecasts-Moderate-Global-Equity-Returns-Solid-High-Yield-Bond-Performance-and-Strength-in-Private-Credit,2025-02-06 09:30:00," CHICAGO & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Northern Trust today issued its Capital Market Assumptions 2025 Edition, forecasting moderate global equity performance, improving high yield bond returns and strength in private credit.   The CMA also identifies three key trends likely to affect markets and the global economy over the next decade – AI-Enabled Productivity, Navigating the Energy Transition and Globalization: Bent, Not Broken – that provide the foundation for returns of stocks, bonds, real assets and alternatives.   “The next 10 years will present investors with a complex landscape of market and economic trends to navigate,” Northern Trust Asset Management (NTAM) Global Chief Investment Officer Angelo Manioudakis said. “As economic growth moderates, we think investors will look to uncover future drivers of growth. We believe the adoption of AI, new energy sources and trends in global trade will cause divergent paths in economic growth globally.”   Over the coming decade, Northern Trust forecasts the following long-term average annualized return expectations for a wide range of asset classes:    Equities: 7.5% annualized return for U.S. equities and 5.8% annualized return for developed markets ex-U.S. equities, as we expect U.S. stocks to continue to outperform European stocks, and 6.4% annualized return for emerging markets.    Fixed Income: 4.7% annualized return for U.S. investment grade bonds and 5.6% annualized return for U.S. high yield bonds, with strong fundamentals supporting high yield securities.    Real Assets: 6.6% annualized return for global listed infrastructure, where utilities could benefit from a surge in electricity demand from AI.    Alternatives: 8.4% annualized return for private credit and 10.1% annualized return for private equity, supported by AI opportunities and potentially more mergers and acquisitions.    “Over the next decade, we expect equity returns to moderate from the highs of the last couple of years. In the bond market, we believe credit spreads will increase from current low levels but stay below the long-term average, supported by stable economic growth and solid credit fundamentals,” NTAM Chief Investment Officer of Global Asset Allocation Anwiti Bahuguna said. “Private investments may prove to offer even more attractive returns relative to the public equity and bond markets. Declining interest rates will drive demand for private credit to boost M&A activity, while AI and other technology advances will push low double-digit growth in private equity and venture capital.”   The CMA’s asset class forecasts are driven by three key themes that Northern Trust investment experts see affecting markets and the economy over the next 10 years:    AI-Enabled Productivity: As companies invest in artificial intelligence, AI-enabled productivity will enhance economic growth. This should help countries combat shifting demographic trends that potentially damage productivity, while also boosting economic growth.    Navigating the Energy Transition: Global energy demand continues to increase, along with a desire for energy independence. Global economies must navigate policy, technological innovations and finance mechanisms to meet those demands. How energy is generated or accessed over the next decade will be critical to long-term economic, climate and investment impacts.    Globalization: Bent, Not Broken: Globalization may have slowed but it has not reversed. Geopolitical tensions are morphing supply chains and trade pacts, which will lead to risks and opportunities over the next decade. This may present investors with the opportunity to be increasingly selective.    Rooted in deep capital market analysis, the CMA is an annual report of long-term average annualized return expectations for a range of asset classes, including fixed income, equities, real assets and alternatives. The CMA informs Northern Trust’s investment decisions and strategic asset allocation recommendations. The full report, including detailed 10-year asset class forecasts, is available at https://www.northerntrust.com/insights-research/2025/investment-managment/capital-markets-assumption-2025.

Kao zum 5. Mal in Folge mit CDP Triple A ausgezeichnet,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206004787/de,2025-02-06 08:30:00," TOKIO & DARMSTADT, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kao, Hersteller von Körperpflege- und Haushaltsprodukten, Kosmetika und Spezialchemikalien, wurde von der globalen Non-Profit-Organisation CDP in ihrer jährlichen weltweiten Umfrage zu den Nachhaltigkeitsinitiativen von Unternehmen in den Kategorien Klimawandel, Wälder und Wassersicherheit mit einer „Triple A“-Bewertung ausgezeichnet. Kao ist eines von wenigen Unternehmen, das von CDP mit einem ""Triple A"" ausgezeichnet wurde - von mehr als 24.800 Organisationen, die an der Umfrage teilgenommen haben. Es ist das fünfte Mal, dass Kao mit einem “Triple A” ausgezeichnet wurde. Kao wurde das sechste Mal in die „A“-Liste der Kategorie Klimawandel aufgenommen sowie das fünfte Mal in der Kategorie Wälder und das achte Mal in der Kategorie Wassersicherheit.   Junko Ohtani, Executive Officer und verantwortlich für die ESG-Division von Kao, kommentiert: ""Es ist eine große Ehre, zum fünften Mal in Folge als CDP-Triple-A-Unternehmen ausgewählt worden zu sein. Wir engagieren uns seit langem konsequent für die Bewältigung ökologischer und sozialer Herausforderungen, indem wir gemeinsam mit all unseren Stakeholdern entlang des gesamten Produktlebenszyklus zusammenarbeiten. Unser Ziel ist es, Produkte anzubieten, die nicht nur nachhaltiger sind, sondern auch leistungsstarke Lösungen für Herausforderungen des täglichen Lebens bieten. Damit möchten wir unseren Verbrauchern ein besseres und komfortables Leben ermöglichen. Dieser Ansatz bildet die Grundlage für unsere ESG-Strategie, den Kirei Lifestyle Plan, der nicht nur Leitlinie für unser aktuelles, sondern auch für unser zukünftiges Geschäft bildet. Wir werden unsere Bemühungen in dem breiten Spektrum unserer Geschäftsbereiche fortsetzen, um unsere Mission eines ‚Kirei-Lifestyles‘ für alle zu verwirklichen.“   Die wichtigsten Initiativen von Kao in Bezug auf Klimawandel, Wälder und Wassersicherheit  Mit dem Ziel, die Dekarbonisierung in der Gesellschaft und eine nachhaltige Geschäftsentwicklung voranzutreiben, stellt Kao innovative Technologien her und arbeitet mit Interessengruppen zusammen, um die CO2-Emissionen in der gesamten Wertschöpfungskette zu reduzieren. Ziel von Kao ist es, seinen CO2-Nettoausstoß bis zum Jahr 2040 auf null zu reduzieren und bis 2050 kohlenstoffnegativ zu werden.   Im Bereich Wälder fördert Kao die nachhaltigkeitsgerechte Beschaffung mit Schwerpunkt auf Umweltschutz, Ressourcenschutz und Menschenrechte. Durch die Sicherstellung der Rückverfolgbarkeit und den Dialog mit Lieferanten will Kao bis 2025 die Waldabholzung auf null reduzieren, was im Einklang mit dem Ziel einer nachhaltigen Beschaffung steht. Beispielsweise hat Kao in Bezug auf Palmöl, einem der wichtigsten natürlichen Ressourcen von Kao, auf RSPO-zertifiziertes Öl umgestellt und zudem das SMILE-Programme eingeführt (Smallholder Inclusion for Better Livelihood & Empowerment program), womit unabhängige Palmöl-Kleinbauern in Indonesien unterstützt werden.   Kao legt außerdem großen Wert auf die nachhaltige Nutzung von Wasserressourcen, weshalb verschiedene Initiativen in diesem Bereich eingeführt wurden. So engagiert sich Kao während des gesamten Produktlebenszyklus für einen ressourcenschonenden Umgang mit Wasser, etwa indem das Unternehmen wassersparende Produkte wie Attack ZERO, ein konzentriertes Flüssigwaschmittel, und CuCute, ein schnell abspülendes Geschirrspülmittel, anbietet.   Über den Kirei Lifestyle Plan  In den vergangenen 130 Jahren hat Kao daran gearbeitet, das Leben der Menschen zu verbessern und ihnen zu einem nachhaltigeren Lebensstil zu verhelfen - einem Kirei Lifestyle.

Verne Expands Helsinki Data Center Campus With Strategic Site Acquisition,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206553002/en/Verne-Expands-Helsinki-Data-Center-Campus-With-Strategic-Site-Acquisition,2025-02-06 08:30:00," LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Verne, the leading provider of sustainably powered HPC data centers across the Nordics, has acquired the land at its existing Helsinki data center campus, securing room for future expansion. This purchase marks another milestone in Verne’s ambitious growth strategy for the Nordics, following the recent announcement of its new facility to be built in Mäntsälä, Finland.     Room to grow  Verne plans to develop the site further, leveraging its 70MW capacity to meet the increasing demand for sustainable, high-performance compute infrastructure. The land was acquired from Onvest, a family-owned company with a long history in the region.   The existing site in Helsinki currently serves a number of high-profile multinational customers. Its strategic location provides excellent connectivity to power and fibre networks, proximity to Helsinki Airport, and easy access to the city centre – making it ideal for organisations across industries looking for reliable, accessible, and well-connected facilities.   Designed with high-density compute in mind, the planned expansion will include two new buildings fully equipped to meet the technical requirements of AI, HPC, and other intensive workloads.   Sustainability at the core  Verne remains committed to sustainability, with the Helsinki campus running on 100 percent renewable energy. Waste heat generated by the data center is repurposed through a direct connection to the local district heating network.   All new facilities will be built to support liquid cooling, enabling efficient management of the high heat levels generated by AI and other intensive compute workloads. This design makes the existing heat reuse infrastructure even more vital, facilitating the effective capture and repurposing of waste heat.   Additionally, Verne uses renewable diesel for its backup power generators in Finland, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the generators by an average of 90 percent.   “The acquisition of this site reinforces Verne’s long-term commitment to Finland and provides an even stronger foundation for our continued growth in the region,” said Dominic Ward, CEO of Verne. “We’ve seen a huge uplift in demand, and having successfully operated from this location for a number of years, we are well-positioned to scale our capabilities and continue delivering industry-leading, sustainable data center solutions to support the next generation of AI and high-performance computing.”   For more information, visit: www.verneglobal.com  About Verne  Verne provides sustainable data center services that enable organisations to cost-effectively scale their digital infrastructure while reducing their environmental impact. The company’s four Nordic data centers, located in Iceland and Finland, are powered by 100 percent renewable energy, optimised for high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI) and other intensive workloads, and supported by a dedicated team of onsite experts. Verne also operates a hyper-connected data center in central London, which serves as a strategic hub for applications requiring low latency and robust connectivity.  "

The Board of Directors met on February 5, 2025 and reviewed the financial data for the first half of FY25 year and approved this press release. These financial data are preliminary, the financial results for the first half of FY25 will be approved by the Board of Directors on February 12th, 2025. The limited review procedures by the Statutory Auditors are ongoing.  All growth data specified in this press release refers to organic growth (at constant FX and Group structure), unless otherwise stated. Data may be subject to rounding.  Definitions and reconciliation of non-IFRS measures to IFRS measures  Pernod Ricard’s management process is based on the following non-IFRS measures which are chosen for planning and reporting. The Group’s management believes these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in understanding the Group’s performance. These non-IFRS measures should be considered as complementary to the comparable IFRS measures and reported movements therein.  Organic growth   Organic growth is calculated after excluding the impacts of exchange rate movements, acquisitions and disposals, changes in applicable accounting principles and hyperinflation.   Exchange rates impact is calculated by translating the current year results at the prior year’s exchange rates and adding the year-on-year variance in the reported transaction impact between the current year and the previous year.   For acquisitions in the current year, the post-acquisition results are excluded from the organic movement calculations. For acquisitions in the prior year, post-acquisition results are included in the prior year but are included in the organic movement calculations of the current year only from the anniversary date of the acquisition.   The impact of hyperinflation on Profit from Recurring Operations in Turkey and Argentina is excluded from organic growth calculations by capping local unit price/cost increases to a maximum of +26% per year, equivalent to +100% over three years.   Where a business, brand, brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of or terminated in the prior year, the Group excludes the results for that business from the prior year in the organic movement calculations. For disposals or terminations in the current year, the Group excludes the results for that business from the prior year from the date of the disposal or termination.   This measure enables users to compare the Group’s performance on a like-for-like basis, focusing on areas that local management is most directly able to influence.   Profit from recurring operations  ​Profit from recurring operations corresponds to the operating profit excluding other non-recurring operating income and expenses.

Le Conseil d'Administration de Pernod Ricard s'est réuni le 5 février 2025. Il a examiné les données financières relatives au premier semestre de l'exercice fiscal 2024/2025 et validé le présent communiqué de presse. Ces données financières sont préliminaires, les comptes semestriels devant être arrêtés par le Conseil d'Administration du 12 février 2025. Les procédures d’examen limité par les Commissaires aux Comptes sont en cours.  Toutes les données de croissance indiquées dans ce communiqué font référence à la croissance organique, sauf mention contraire. Les chiffres peuvent faire l’objet d’arrondis.  Définitions et rapprochement des indicateurs alternatifs de performance avec les indicateurs IFRS  Le processus de gestion de Pernod Ricard repose sur les indicateurs alternatifs de performance suivants, choisis pour la planification et le reporting. La direction du Groupe estime que ces indicateurs fournissent des renseignements supplémentaires utiles pour les utilisateurs des états financiers pour comprendre la performance du Groupe. Ces indicateurs alternatifs de performance doivent être considérés comme complémentaires des indicateurs IFRS et des mouvements qui en découlent.  Croissance organique   La croissance organique est calculée en excluant les impacts des variations des taux de change, des acquisitions et cessions ainsi que des changements dans les principes comptables applicables.   L’impact des taux de change est calculé en convertissant les résultats de l'exercice en cours aux taux de change de l'exercice précédent.   Pour les acquisitions de l'exercice en cours, les résultats post-acquisition sont exclus des calculs de croissance interne. Pour les acquisitions de l'exercice précédent, les résultats post-acquisition sont inclus sur l’exercice précédent, mais sont inclus dans le calcul de la croissance organique sur l’exercice en cours seulement à partir de la date anniversaire d'acquisition.   Lorsqu'une activité, une marque, un droit de distribution de marque ou un accord de marque d’agence a été cédé ou résilié, sur l’exercice précédent, le Groupe, pour le calcul de la croissance interne, exclut les résultats de cette activité sur l’exercice précédent. Pour les cessions ou résiliations de l’exercice en cours, le Groupe exclut les résultats de cette activité sur l’exercice précédent à partir de la date de cession ou résiliation.   L’impact de l'hyperinflation sur le résultat opérationnel courant réalisé en Turquie et Argentine est exclu de la croissance interne en plafonnant les hausses de prix et coûts unitaires locaux à un maximum de +26% par an, équivalent à +100% sur 3 ans.   Cet indicateur permet de se concentrer sur la performance du Groupe commune aux deux exercices, performance que le management local est plus directement en mesure d'influencer.   Résultat Opérationnel Courant  Le Résultat opérationnel courant correspond au résultat opérationnel avant autres produits et charges opérationnels non courants  A propos de Pernod Ricard  Pernod Ricard est un leader de l’industrie des vins et spiritueux, associant des savoir-faire uniques dans la fabrication de ses produits, la construction de ses marques et leur distribution mondiale.

ACI verarbeitet Konto-zu-Konto-Zahlungen für Hunderte von Zahlungsdienstleistern in Europa und Großbritannien mit marktführenden Sofortzahlungslösungen. Durch die Partnerschaft mit Banfico wird ACI britische und europäische Banken und Zahlungsdienstleister (PSP) dabei unterstützen, die Auflagen zur Bereitstellung von Diensten zur Bestätigung des Zahlungsempfängers (Confirmation of Payee, CoP) und zur Überprüfung des Zahlungsempfängers (Verification of Payee, VOP) zu erfüllen.   Der VOP-Dienst ist eine europaweite regulatorische Anforderung im Rahmen der neuen europäischen Verordnung über Echtzeitzahlungen, die alle PSPs bis Oktober 2025 einhalten müssen. VOP ermöglicht es PSPs, Kontonamen und -nummern vor der Ausführung einer Überweisung zu bestätigen, und soll die Zahlungssicherheit im gesamten einheitlichen Euro-Zahlungsverkehrsraum erhöhen und die wachsende Betrugsgefahr, einschließlich des Betrugs mit autorisierten Push-Zahlungen (APP), bekämpfen.   Darüber hinaus ist Banfico ein von Pay.UK zertifizierter CoP-Aggregator, der es ACI ermöglicht, neuen und bestehenden Kunden von Faster Payments in Großbritannien CoP-Dienste anzubieten. CoP – ein Dienst zur Kontoverifizierung/Namensprüfung für Zahlungen mit Sitz in Großbritannien – bietet Verbrauchern eine größere Sicherheit, dass sie Zahlungen an den vorgesehenen Empfänger senden. Diese zusätzliche Sicherheit hilft Verbrauchern, versehentliche Zahlungen an den falschen Kontoinhaber zu vermeiden, und bietet eine weitere Schutzebene im Kampf gegen Betrug und Identitätsdiebstahl.   „Kontoverifizierungsdienste sind ein entscheidender Bestandteil moderner Zahlungssysteme. VOP ist eine wichtige Anforderung im Rahmen der europäischen Verordnung über Echtzeitzahlungen.

ACI Worldwide étend son écosystème de partenariat fintech pour lutter contre la fraude aux paiements push autorisés en Europe et au Royaume-Uni,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250205950697/fr,2025-02-06 07:30:00," OMAHA, Nebraska et LONDRES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ACI Worldwide (NASDAQ : ACIW), un innovateur original dans le domaine des technologies mondiales de paiement, a annoncé l’extension de son écosystème de partenariat fintech par le biais d’une alliance avec Banfico, une fintech de premier plan spécialisée dans la technologie réglementaire, la vérification des comptes à l’échelle mondiale et les solutions d’open banking.     ACI traite les paiements de compte à compte pour des centaines de prestataires de services de paiement (PSP) en Europe et au Royaume-Uni grâce à des solutions de paiements instantanés à la pointe du marché. Grâce à son partenariat avec Banfico, ACI aidera les banques et PSP britanniques et européens à se conformer à l’obligation d’offrir des services de confirmation du bénéficiaire (Confirmation of Payee, CoP) et de vérification du bénéficiaire (Verification of Payee, VOP).   Le service VOP est une exigence réglementaire paneuropéenne dans le cadre du nouveau Règlement européen sur les paiements instantanés, auquel tous les PSP devront se conformer d’ici octobre 2025. Le service VOP permet aux PSP de confirmer les noms et numéros de compte avant d’exécuter un virement. Il est conçu pour renforcer la sécurité des paiements dans l’espace unique de paiement en euros (SEPA) et pour lutter contre la menace croissante de la fraude, y compris la fraude aux paiements push autorisés (Authorized Push Payments, APP).   En outre, Banfico est un agrégateur CoP certifié par Pay.UK, ce qui permet à ACI d’offrir des services CoP aux clients nouveaux et existants du service Faster Payments au Royaume-Uni. CoP – un service de vérification des comptes et des noms pour les paiements effectués au Royaume-Uni – offre aux consommateurs une meilleure assurance qu’ils envoient leurs paiements au bon destinataire. Cette couche de sécurité supplémentaire permet aux consommateurs d’éviter d’effectuer des paiements accidentels au mauvais titulaire du compte et constitue un niveau de protection additionnelle dans la lutte contre la fraude et les usurpations d’identité.   « Les services de vérification des comptes constituent un élément critique des systèmes de paiement modernes. Le service VOP est une exigence clé du Règlement européen sur les paiements instantanés. De la même façon, au Royaume-Uni, la plupart des grandes banques et des PSP ont mis en œuvre des services CoP pour renforcer la sécurité des paiements et réduire la fraude APP », a commenté Nick Craig, responsable de la région Europe chez ACI Worldwide. « Le partenariat avec Banfico permet à ACI d’aider ses clients à se conformer plus rapidement aux nouvelles exigences du marché et exigences réglementaires et à rendre les paiements instantanés plus sûrs. »   « Nous sommes ravis de notre partenariat avec ACI Worldwide, qui permet de combiner le meilleur des deux mondes : les capacités inégalées d’ACI en matière de technologie logicielle de paiement avec l’expertise de Banfico en matière de services de vérification des comptes », a confié pour sa part Kannan Rasappan, PDG de Banfico. « Notre partenariat avec ACI Worldwide renforce l’engagement de Banfico envers le marché britannique et européen et va nous permettre d’innover en matière de solutions réglementaires au profit des banques de la région. »   À propos d'ACI Worldwide  ACI Worldwide, un innovateur original dans le domaine des technologies mondiales de paiement, propose des solutions logicielles transformatrices qui permettent une orchestration intelligente des paiements en temps réel afin que les banques, les émetteurs de factures et les commerçants puissent stimuler la croissance, tout en modernisant en continu leurs infrastructures de paiement, simplement et en toute sécurité.

Cela témoigne du succès de notre plan de refondation entrepris depuis mi-2022 et de la mobilisation de toutes les équipes d’emeis.  Tous nos fondamentaux progressent, notamment nos indicateurs de qualité et de satisfaction de nos résidents et patients. Notre taux d’occupation est en hausse dans toutes les zones géographiques et notre performance est également portée par des marges opérationnelles en forte augmentation sur la deuxième partie de l’année.  emeis est aujourd’hui en ordre de marche. Nous continuons à nous transformer pour répondre efficacement, et de manière responsable, aux enjeux sociétaux majeurs que sont la santé mentale, physique, et le grand âge. Les perspectives de nos marchés sont porteuses : le déficit structurel d’offre des maisons de retraite devrait atteindre 800 000 lits d’ici 2035, sur les 5 principaux marchés d’emeis.  emeis deviendra en 2025, une société à mission : cet ambitieux engagement mobilise toutes nos équipes au service du soin et de l’accompagnement personnalisés pour chaque personne fragilisée. »  A propos de emeis  Avec près de 78 000 experts et professionnels de la santé, du soin, et de l’accompagnement des plus fragiles, emeis est présent dans une vingtaine de pays et couvre cinq métiers : les cliniques psychiatriques, les cliniques de soins médicaux et de réadaptation, les maisons de retraite, les services et soins à domicile et les résidences services.   emeis accueille chaque année près de 283 000 résidents, patients et bénéficiaires. emeis s’engage et se mobilise pour relever un des enjeux majeurs de nos sociétés : l’augmentation du nombre des populations fragilisées par les accidents de la vie, par le grand âge ou encore par les maladies mentales.   emeis, détenue à 50,2% par la Caisse des Dépôts, CNP Assurances, MAIF et MACSF Epargne Retraite, est cotée sur Euronext Paris (ISIN : FR001400NLM4) et membre des indices SBF 120 et CAC Mid 60.

Cette hausse est le reflet de la combinaison de trois facteurs, tous favorablement orientés :    Effet prix positif, soutenant la croissance organique à hauteur de +4,8 %    Progression du taux d’occupation moyen à fin décembre de l’ordre de +2,7pts, qui contribue pour +1,8% à la croissance organique    Contribution des nouveaux établissements ouverts ces deux dernières années, en phase de ramp-up (+1,6%)    La performance est particulièrement importante sur les marchés européens non domestiques, bénéficiant d’impacts tarifaires forts en Allemagne et en Autriche notamment, mais également aux Pays Bas et en Belgique, et d’une nette progression du taux d’occupation en particulier en Espagne et en Suisse. En France, la croissance est majoritairement portée par un effet prix favorable.   La croissance organique du chiffre d’affaires du Groupe est principalement portée par les maisons de retraite (près de 2/3 de l’activité du Groupe), dont le chiffre d’affaires croit de près de +11%, sous l’effet d’une importante remontée du taux d’occupation moyen (de près de +3pts en 2024). L’activité Cliniques est quant à elle en progression de près de +4%.   En France (42% du chiffre d’affaires Groupe), le périmètre des maisons de retraite dont le chiffre d’affaires est en hausse organique de +6%, est le principal contributeur de la croissance du chiffre d’affaires sur la zone.   En Allemagne (17% du chiffre d’affaires Groupe), la hausse du chiffre d’affaires s’établit à +10,8% en périmètre organique, principalement sous l’effet d’un effet prix très favorable qui vient compléter les bénéfices d’un taux d’occupation qui continue de s’améliorer (+3pts).

Sur le seul 4ème trimestre, le taux d’occupation moyen ressort à 86,2%, supérieur à la moyenne sur l’ensemble de l’exercice, traduisant ainsi la confirmation d’une dynamique favorable qui se dessine depuis le 2ème trimestre et qui nourrit notre confiance en matière d’occupation pour 2025.   Le redressement est notamment porté par les maisons de retraite dont le taux d’occupation atteint 85,3%, en hausse de +3 pts sur un an (vs. 82,1% fin 2023).   Il est également en hausse de +1,1 pt sur les cliniques à 87,5% (vs. 86,4% fin 2023).   Notons que ces taux d’occupation seraient supérieurs sur le seul périmètre mature, en excluant les ouvertures récentes et les établissements mis en restructuration, dont les taux d’occupation ne sont pas encore à maturité. En excluant ces établissements, le taux d’occupation moyen du Groupe serait +2pts plus élevé, se rapprochant ainsi de 88% en moyenne. L’exclusion des établissements en « ramp up » augmenterait les taux d’occupation aux Pays-Bas de près de +5pts et de près de +4pts dans les pays d’Europe du Sud (Portugal et Espagne).   Les tendances qui se dessinaient à la fin du premier semestre sont ainsi confirmées sur ce second semestre, permettant de réaliser une progression des taux d’occupation sur l’ensemble des zones géographiques sur lesquelles le Groupe opère. Bien que les niveaux atteints restent en deçà des ambitions du Groupe, la dynamique de reprise est encourageante et confirme la tendance favorable sur laquelle le Groupe s’inscrit.    En France (42% du chiffre d’affaires du Groupe), le taux d’occupation moyen depuis le début de l’année s’inscrit en hausse de +0,7pt à 86,1%. Cette progression est le reflet d’une amélioration séquentielle, chaque trimestre de l’année, de l’occupation des établissements. Sur le seul quatrième trimestre ce taux ressort à 86,8%, soit légèrement au-dessus de la moyenne du Groupe, et près de +110pb au-delà du niveau observé au dernier trimestre 2023.   En Europe du Nord, en Europe Centrale, et en Europe du Sud (54% du chiffre d’affaires du Groupe), l’amélioration est notable avec un taux d’occupation moyen depuis le début de l’année en hausse respectivement de +4,4pts, +3,3pts et +3,7pts. En particulier, les établissements espagnols et d’Europe Centrale, dont les taux d’occupation sont désormais proches voire au-delà de 90%, se rapprochent désormais des niveaux pré-covid.    3- Marges opérationnelles : objectifs dépassés avec un rebond amorcé au second semestre 2024    En M€7    2023     2024     % Var.

L’EBITDA (hors IFRS 16) ressortirait en hausse de l’ordre de +20%, proche de 245 M€, soit +35 M€ au-delà de la guidance 2024 (à 210 M€).   Sur 6 mois, forte reprise de l’EBITDAR (+19%) et de l’EBITDA hors IFRS 16 (+67%)  Cette performance est le résultat d’une année très contrastée avec, au premier semestre, des marges mises transitoirement sous pression par le décalage mécanique entre l’impact immédiat des mesures de relance sur les charges de personnel, et le bénéfice progressif de ces mesures sur le taux d’occupation, et donc sur le chiffre d’affaires.   Le second semestre 2024 affiche en revanche un net rebond de ces marges opérationnelles, avec la maitrise des charges de personnels (+0,5% donc stables par rapport au premier semestre), ainsi que la poursuite de l’amélioration des taux d’occupation. En conséquence, l’EBITDAR sur le second semestre ressortirait +19% au-delà de celui enregistré au premier semestre, et l’EBITDA hors IFRS 16 afficherait même un différentiel de +67%.   Bien que les marges affichées soient en deçà des niveaux normatifs attendus à terme, le second semestre illustre une dynamique favorable qui devrait se prolonger dans les semestres qui viennent.   4- Avancée des cessions : 916 M€ réalisées ou sécurisées, soit 60% de l’ambition de 1,5 Md€ d’ici fin 2025  A fin décembre 2024, le volume de cessions signées depuis mi-2022 s’élève à 916 M€8, principalement constitué d’opérations de « sale & lease back », mais également des premières cessions d’actifs opérationnelles. Les cessions réalisées en 2024 font ressortir des plus-values de cessions de l’ordre de 30 M€9.    En 2024, un total de 624 M€ de cessions ont été finalisées ou sont aujourd’hui sécurisées, comprenant :   287 M€ de cessions immobilières finalisées au cours de l’exercice, dont 47% en « sale & lease back »    166 M€ d’opérations immobilières signées et sécurisés à date, mais non encore encaissées    171 M€10 d’actifs opérationnels cédés à des opérateurs de santé en République Tchèque et au Chili      Pour rappel, afin de poursuivre son désendettement et assurer les engagements pris vis-à-vis des partenaires bancaires, le Groupe avait relevé à 1,5 Md€ (entre mi-2022 et fin 2025) ses ambitions de cessions, intégrant la cession d’actifs immobiliers (PropCo) et opérationnels (OpCo). Cette ambition est aujourd’hui confirmée et confortée.   Cette ambition laisse près de 600 M€ de cessions restant à date à réaliser d’ici fin 2025, qui mobilise aujourd’hui les équipes du Groupe sur des marchés de l’investissement encore convalescents, mais qui semblent se réouvrir progressivement.   A date, plus de 2 Mds€ de cessions éventuelles (PropCo et/ou OpCo)) font aujourd’hui l’objet de discussions ou de négociations entre emeis et plusieurs acquéreurs potentiels, preuve à la fois du dynamisme des équipes d’emeis mais également de l’appétit croissant des investisseurs pour les actifs de santé.   5- Dette nette et position de trésorerie à fin 2024  A fin décembre 2024, la dette nette du Groupe s’élève à environ 4 781 M€ (hors ajustements IFRS), à comparer à 4 676 M€ à fin 2023.   La position de trésorerie du Groupe s’élève à fin 2024 à 524 M€, en baisse de -129 M€ au cours du second semestre 2024. Cette variation est la conséquence :    Du remboursement de crédits arrivés à échéance (-407 M€).    Du tirage d’une ligne de crédit (+400 M€)    D’opérations de cessions (+161 M€) et des effets de débouclages d’engagements passés (-138 M€)    De l’avancée des programmes d’investissements et d’éléments non courants (-95 M€), à comparer à -190 M€ au premier semestre 2024    Des autres éléments de cash flow récurrent qui restent encore négatifs sur le semestre (-49 M€), bien qu’en très forte amélioration par rapport au premier semestre. A titre de comparaison ces éléments représentaient -131 M€ sur les 6 premiers mois de l’année.    6- Valeur patrimoniale expertisées à fin 2024 : un bas de cycle immobilier ?  A fin décembre 2024, la valeur du patrimoine immobilier du Groupe devrait être de l’ordre de 6,1 Mds€11. A périmètre constant, le portefeuille expertisé à fin 2024 s’inscrit en baisse de -4,8% par rapport à fin 2023, avec un taux de rendement net moyen en hausse de près de +35pb à 6,3%, reflétant des tendances encore contrastées entre les zones géographiques.    Les expertises sont orientées à la hausse en Europe centrale (+2%) et dans les zones périphériques (Irlande et Pologne notamment)    En France, en Europe du Sud et en Europe du Nord, les expertises s’inscrivent encore à la baisse (respectivement de -9%, -3% et -3%), principalement sous l’effet d’une hausse résiduelle des taux de capitalisation, mais la tendance est contrastée au sein de ces zones entre les pays.    En France (près de la moitié du patrimoine expertisé), le rendement moyen ressortirait maintenant autour de 6,4% (+50pb sur un an).   Sur les autres secteurs les taux de rendements sont stables ou en hausse de moindre ampleur (+10pb en Europe du Nord à 5,7%, en Europe Centrale à 6,7% par exemple, et +40pb en Europe du Sud proche de 6,1%).   Ces tendances contrastées selon les zones ainsi que la reconstitution des primes de risques immobilières pourraient indiquer des valorisations du patrimoine proches d’un bas de cycle immobilier.   7- Perspectives et Guidance 2025  Les perspectives des marchés de références du Groupe à moyen terme sont particulièrement porteuses pour les activités de soins et d’accompagnement des personnes les plus fragiles.  La population des séniors âgés de plus de 75 ans devrait croitre de plus de +30% d’ici 10 ans pour représenter 14% de la population. Le déficit structurel d’offre sur les marchés des maisons de retraite s’accentuera en conséquence chaque année, pour atteindre un déficit de l’ordre de 550 000 lits d’ici 2030 et de 800 000 lits d’ici 2035 sur les 5 principaux marchés d’emeis. A titre d’illustration permettant de mesurer l’importance de cette carence future de l’offre, le marché français compte aujourd’hui 650 000 lits au total.   La prévalence des troubles psychologiques et des maladies chroniques continue également de croitre significativement, créant là encore un risque d’offre insuffisante dans les années qui viennent.   Cette situation de pénurie majeure offre au Groupe emeis une solide visibilité pour les années qui viennent, avec une offre correspondant à une demande en forte croissance.   A court terme, la trajectoire de reprise opérationnelle se confirme, notamment depuis le second semestre 2024. Cette tendance se prolongera en 2025 sous les effets combinés d’un redressement des taux d’occupation, de la capture d’effets prix favorables et de la meilleure maitrise des charges opérationnelles.   emeis communiquera chaque année les tendances anticipées pour l’exercice en cours. Les tendances attendues pour 2025 semblent porteuses. Dès lors, en 2025, le Groupe anticipe ainsi un EBITDAR en hausse de +15% à +18% à périmètre constant (excluant les effets des cessions opérationnelles éventuelles en 2025) par rapport à 2024, prolongeant et accentuant ainsi la dynamique d’amélioration de la performance engagée ces derniers trimestres.

emeis: 2024 Guidance Beaten,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250205588163/en/emeis%C2%A02024-Guidance-Beaten,2025-02-06 07:00:00," PUTEAUX, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:   emeis (Paris:EMEIS):   Improvement in fundamental indicators   Resident satisfaction rate of 93%, almost +3 points above the 2022 level    Net Promoter Score from residents up +13 points over the same period    Rate of conversion of visits into resident admissions of over 60% in the second half of 2024 and number of admissions to our facilities up by +10% in 2024 in France    Stability of care teams: staff turnover and absenteeism rates are down, reinforcing continuity and quality of care    Strong business growth   Solid organic revenue growth (+8.3%), particularly in nursing homes (+10.8%), reflecting the benefits of measures taken since mid-2022    Occupancy rates up in all areas and all core activities (by 2.7 points on average, to 85.8%)   Occupancy rate of 84.1% (+50 bps in one year) for nursing homes in France, where it exceeded 85% in the last quarter    Positive price effect across all the Group's markets (+4.8% on average in 2024)    Operating margins recovered in the second half of 2024, exceeding guidance   EBITDAR of €740m (vs. €710m to €730m expected) and EBITDA (excluding IFRS 16) of around €245m (vs. the €210m expected)    EBITDAR up +19% in the second half of the year compared with the first half of 2024, and up +6% year-on-year (vs. 2023)    EBITDA (excluding IFRS 16), up by nearly +66% in the second half of the year compared with the first half of 2024, and up by 20% year-on-year (vs. 2023)    The upturn was also driven by strict control of operating expenses   The net impact of asset impairment should be close to zero on emeis Balance Sheet at end 2024    €916m2 in disposals already completed or secured, and €2bn potential disposals under discussions   €745m in real estate disposals, including €579 m already received since mid-2022 (€287m in 2024) and €166m already secured but not yet received.

This testifies to the success of our Refoundation Plan, which has been underway since mid-2022, and to the commitment of all the emeis teams.  All of our fundamental indicators are improving, particularly the perception of quality and satisfaction among our residents and patients, our occupancy rate is up in all geographical areas and our performance is also being driven by a sharp increase in operating margins in the second half of the year.  emeis is now fully up and running. We will continue to transform the organisation in order to effectively and responsibly meet the major societal challenges of mental and physical health and old age. Our market outlook is promising: In emeis’ five main markets, the structural shortfall in supply in the nursing home market is expected to reach 800,000 beds by 2035.  Together with all our teams, emeis will become in 2025, a mission-led company (société à mission): an ambitious corporate project to provide personalised care and support to all vulnerable people.”  About emeis  With nearly 78,000 experts and professionals in healthcare, care, and supporting the most vulnerable among us, emeis operates in around 20 countries with five core activities: psychiatric hospitals, post-acute and rehabilitation hospitals, nursing homes, home care services, and assisted-living facilities.   Every year, emeis welcomes 283,000 residents, patients, and other beneficiaries. emeis is committed and is taking action to rise to a major challenge facing our society, i.e., the increase in the number of people placed in vulnerable positions as a result of accidents or old age, and the rising number of cases of mental illness.   emeis is 50.2% owned by Caisse des Dépôts, CNP Assurances, MAIF, and MACSF Épargne Retraite.

The increase reflects a combination of three factors which are all moving in the right direction:    Positive price effect, adding +4.8% to organic growth    Average occupancy rate up +2.7 points over the year, contributing +1.8% to organic growth    Contribution from new facilities opened in the last two years, in the ramp-up phase (+1.6%)    Performance was particularly strong in non-domestic European markets, benefiting from significant price impacts in Germany and Austria in particular, but also in the Netherlands and Belgium, and from a sharp increase in occupancy, especially in Spain and Switzerland. In France, growth was mainly driven by a favourable price effect.   Organic Growth in Group revenue was primarily led by nursing homes (nearly two-thirds of the Group’s business), with revenue rising by almost +11%, due to a significant increase in the average occupancy rate (up nearly +3 points in 2024). The clinic business is up +4%.   In France (42% of total Group revenue), the main contributor to growth was the nursing homes network, which delivered organic revenue growth of +6%.   In Germany (17% of total Group revenue), revenue rose by +10.8% on an organic basis, mainly as a result of a very favourable price effect that added to the benefits of a continuously improving occupancy rate (+3 points).

In the fourth quarter alone, the average occupancy rate was 86.2%, higher than the average for the year as a whole, a continuation of the favourable momentum that has been building since the second quarter and which is fuelling our confidence in terms of occupancy for 2025.   The recovery was led mainly by nursing homes, where the occupancy rate reached 85.3%, up +3 points year-on-year (vs. 82.1% in 2023).   The occupancy rate was also up by +1.1 points for clinics, to 87.5% (vs. 86.4% in 2023).   It should be noted that these occupancy rates would be higher if they had been based solely on the mature scope, excluding recent openings and facilities undergoing restructuring, whose occupancy rates are not yet mature. Excluding these facilities, the Group's average occupancy rate would be +2 points higher, closer to 88% on average.   Excluding the 'ramp up’ facilities would increase occupancy rates in the Netherlands by almost +5 points and by almost +4 points in Southern European countries (Portugal and Spain).   The trends that began to emerge late in the first half of the year were thus confirmed during the second half, enabling us to report an increase in occupancy rates across all of the Group’s geographical areas. Although the levels achieved are still short of the Group’s goals, the upturn is encouraging and confirms the favourable trend benefiting the Group.    In France (42% of Group revenue), the average occupancy rate since the start of the year has risen by +0.7 point to 86.1%. This increase reflects sequential growth in facility occupancy levels from quarter to quarter. In the fourth quarter alone, the occupancy rate was 86.8%, slightly higher than the Group average and almost +110bp above the level seen in fourth-quarter 2023.   In Northern Europe, Central Europe and Southern Europe (54% of revenue), there was a sharp improvement, with the average occupancy rate up by +4.4 points, +3.3 points and +3.7 points respectively since the beginning of the year. It is worth highlighting that the Spanish and Central European facilities, whose occupancy rates are now close to or above 90%, are approaching pre-Covid levels.    3- Operating margins: targets exceeded with a rebound starting in the second half of 2024    In €m7    FY 2023     FY 2024     % change      H1 2024     H2 2024     % change                                                         Revenue     5,198     5,636     +8.4%      2,772     2,864     +3.3%       Personnel costs     (3,469)     (3,802)     +9.6%      (1,896)     (1,905)     +0.5%       Other expenses     (1,032)     (1,093)     +5.9%      (537)     (556)     +3.5%       EBITDAR     696     740     +6%      339     402     +19%       as a % of revenue    13.4%     13.1%     -0.3 pt      12.2%     14.0%     +1.8 pt       Rents     -492     -495     +1%           -247     -249     +1%       as a % of revenue    9.5%    8.7%    -0,8 pt          8.9%    87%    -0,2 pt      EBITDA pre-IFRS 16     204     245     +20%      92     153     +67%       as a % of revenue    3.9%     4.3%     +0.4 pt      3.3%     5.3%     +2.0 pts      2024 EBITDAR and EBITDA targets exceeded (excluding IFRS 16)  EBITDAR is expected to be up by more than +6% at around €740 million for the year, well above the target of between €710 million and €730 million.   EBITDA (excluding IFRS 16) is expected to rise by around +20% to close to €245 million, +€35 million above the 2024 guidance of €210 million.   Over six months, strong recovery in EBITDAR (+19%) and EBITDA excluding IFRS 16 (+67%)  This performance is the result of a very mixed year, with margins temporarily under pressure in the first half due to the automatic time lag between the immediate impact of stimulus measures on payroll costs and the gradual benefit of these measures on occupancy rates, and therefore on revenue.   By contrast, operating margins rebounded sharply in the second half of 2024, with payroll costs under control (up +0.5% on the first half) and occupancy rates continuing to improve. As a result, EBITDAR for the second half was +19% higher than that recorded for the first half, and EBITDA excluding IFRS 16 was even +67% higher.   Although margins are below the normal levels expected in the long run, the second half of the year illustrates a favourable trend which should continue in the coming half-years.   4- Progress on disposals: €916 million completed or secured, i.e., 60% of the €1.5 billion target by the end of 2025  By the end of December 2024, the volume of disposals signed since mid-2022 amounted to €916 million8, mainly comprising sale and leaseback transactions, but also of first-time disposals of operating assets. Disposals in 2024 generated capital gains of around €30 million9.    A total of €624 million in disposals were completed in 2024 or are currently secured, including:   €287 million of real estate disposals completed during the year, 47% of which were sale and leaseback transactions;    €166 million of real estate transactions signed and secured to date, but not yet received;    €171 million10 of operating assets sold to healthcare operators in the Czech Republic and Chile.      As a reminder, in order to continue reducing its debt and meet its commitments to its banking partners, the Group had raised its disposal target to €1.5 billion (between mid-2022 and end-2025), including the sale of real estate (PropCo) and operating assets (OpCo). This target has now been confirmed and strengthened.   To date, this leaves almost €600 million in disposals still to be completed by the end of 2025, with the Group’s teams currently mobilised in dormant investment markets which are starting to show sign of recovery.   To date, more than €2 billion in potential disposals (PropCo and/or OpCo) are currently being discussed or negotiated between emeis and several potential buyers, illustrating both the proactive approach of emeis teams and the growing appetite of investors for healthcare assets.   5- Net debt and cash position at end-2024  At end-December 2024, the Group's net debt was around €4,781 million (excluding IFRS 16 and IFRS 5), compared with €4,676 million at end-2023.   The Group's cash position at the end of 2024 was €524 million, down €129 million in the second half of 2024. This change is due to:    The repayment of maturing loans (negative €407 million);    The drawdown of a credit line (positive €400 million);    Disposals (positive €161 million) and the effects of unwinding past commitments (negative €138 million);    Progress on investment programmes and non-current items (negative €95 million), compared with negative €190 million in the first half of 2024;    Other recurring cash flow items were still negative for the first half (€49 million), although this was a marked improvement on the first half. By way of comparison, these items represented a loss of €131 million over the first half of the year.    6- Appraised asset values at the end of 2024: a low point in the valuation cycle?  At end-December 2024, the value of the Group's real estate portfolio is expected to be around €6.1 billion11. The appraised portfolio at the end of 2024 was down 4.8% like-for-like compared with 2023, with an average net yield up by almost 35 bps to 6.3%, reflecting still contrasting trends between geographical areas.    Appraisal values are on the rise in Central Europe (+2%) and in peripheral regions (Ireland and Poland in particular);    In France, Southern Europe and Northern Europe, appraisal values continued to fall (by -9%, -3% and -3% respectively), mainly due to a residual rise in capitalisation rates; however, the trend within these regions varied from country to country.    In France (almost half of the appraised assets), the average yield is now estimated at around 6.4% (+50 bps year-on-year).   In the other sectors, yields are stable or rising more slowly (+10 points in Northern Europe at 5.7%, in Central Europe at 6.7%, and +40 bps in Southern Europe close to 6.1%).   These contrasting trends by region, together with the redesign of real estate risk premiums, could point to asset values close to the bottom of the real estate downturn cycle.   7- 2025 outlook and guidance  The medium-term outlook for the Group's core markets is particularly promising for its core activity of providing care and support to vulnerable people.  The population of seniors aged over 75 is expected to grow by more than +30% over the next 10 years, reaching 14% of the population. As a result, the structural shortfall in supply in the nursing home markets will grow each year, reaching a deficit of around 550,000 beds by 2030 and 800,000 beds by 2035 in the five main emeis markets. To illustrate the scale of this future shortfall, the French market currently has a total of 650,000 beds.   The prevalence of psychological disorders and chronic illnesses is also continuing to rise significantly, again creating a risk of insufficient supply in the years ahead.   This major shortage situation gives the emeis Group good visibility for the coming years, with supply corresponding to strong growth in demand.   The operational recovery trajectory has been confirmed for the short term, particularly since the second half of 2024. This trend will continue in 2025 as occupancy rates recover, favourable price effects are captured, and operating costs are kept under tight control.   Each year, emeis communicates its anticipated trends for the current financial year, and the trends expected for 2025 look promising. Therefore, in 2025, the Group expects EBITDAR to rise by between +15% and +18% on a like-for-like basis (excluding the effects of any operating asset disposals in 2025) compared with 2024, thereby extending and accentuating the performance improvement momentum seen in recent quarters.

Proposed Delisting via Merger of BenevolentAI into Osaka Holdings S.à r.l. and Publication of Notice of Extraordinary General Meeting,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250205177929/en/Proposed-Delisting-via-Merger-of-BenevolentAI-into-Osaka-Holdings-S.%C3%A0-r.l.-and-Publication-of-Notice-of-Extraordinary-General-Meeting,2025-02-06 06:30:00," LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:     BenevolentAI, (“BenevolentAI” or “the Company”) (Euronext Amsterdam: BAI), a pioneer in AI-driven drug discovery, today announces:    Subject to shareholder approval, the proposed delisting of BenevolentAI from Euronext Amsterdam N.V. (the “Delisting”) via a merger of the Company into Osaka Holdings S.à r.l. (“Osaka Holdings”), (the “Merger”), which will transition the Company to a private company structure.    Simplification of the Company’s share structure and related instruments that reduces the current complexity and administrative overheads.    The convening notice for the Extraordinary General Meeting (the “EGM”), the proxy form and the documents related to the items on the EGM agenda, including the Merger Proposal (as defined and set out below), will be published on or around 10 February 2025.    Background and Reasons for Delisting  Following the announcement on 11 December 2024 and subsequent further detailed review and evaluation, the Board of BenevolentAI has concluded that delisting from Euronext Amsterdam N.V. (“Euronext”) and transitioning to a private company is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board determined that the financial and administrative costs of maintaining a public listing are not justified by the benefits. By eliminating the significant costs associated with its public status, including legal, regulatory, financial, and administrative overheads, the Company can redeploy this capital towards core business activities that drive innovation and product development. This aims to deliver greater value to its shareholders, partners and ultimately benefit the patients it serves.   The proposed Delisting and Merger of BenevolentAI into Osaka Holdings requires passing EGM Resolutions (as defined and set out below). It is important for shareholders to understand that should any of the Resolutions fail to pass, the Delisting and Merger will not proceed. An indicative timetable of the Delisting and the Merger can be found in Appendix I below.   Delisting Implementation  Delisting will be implemented via a merger of BenevolentAI into Osaka Holdings. Osaka Holdings is currently a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg with its registered office at 9, rue de Bitbourg, L-1273 Luxembourg. It is not listed on any exchange and has no assets and no liabilities other than its share capital which will be reduced to zero on Merger. Upon the Merger, scheduled for completion on 12 March 2025, all the Company’s assets, liabilities, rights and obligations will transfers to Osaka Holdings under universal title of succession. This transition will occur in accordance with the Merger proposal that will be published on 10 February 2025 and available on the Company’s website, https://www.benevolent.com/investors/general-meetings/ (the “Merger Proposal”). Additionally, the articles of association of Osaka Holdings post-Merger will be streamlined for a private company and will be set out in Schedule 1 of the Merger Proposal.   Under the terms of the proposed Merger, Osaka Holdings will issue shares and warrants equivalent to the number currently issued by BenevolentAI, after accounting for the conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares, the cancellation of treasury shares, and the treatment of warrants, as set out below. Specifically, for every share or warrant held in BenevolentAI at the time of the Merger, a shareholder or warrant holder will receive one corresponding share or warrant in Osaka Holdings, according to a one-to-one exchange ratio, which is designed to reflect the ownership proportions in Osaka Holdings that existed in BenevolentAI prior to the Merger, helping to ensure a smooth transition for all stakeholders.   If the Resolutions are passed at the EGM, the Merger will become effective once both BenevolentAI and Osaka Holdings have adopted the concurring approval decisions during their respective general meetings on the same day. Consequently, it is envisaged that the Delisting will become effective on 13 March 2025. Upon Delisting, the last day of trading in the class A shares and class A warrants will be 12 March 2025.   Following completion, the newly merged entity will be renamed BenevolentAI.   Conversion of Class B Shares into Class A Shares  BenevolentAI currently has two classes of shares in issue: class A redeemable shares (“Class A shares”) and convertible class B shares (“Class B shares”). The Class B shares were introduced as part of the historic deSPAC process, representing a strategic financing choice at the time. Both classes possess identical rights, including voting privileges and entitlement to dividends. The primary difference is their market presence; Class A shares are publicly traded on Euronext, whereas Class B shares are not publicly traded.   As BenevolentAI transitions to a private entity, the distinction between publicly traded and non-publicly traded shares becomes irrelevant since the Company will no longer be listed on any market. In line with this change, shareholders are asked to vote on a resolution to convert Class B shares into Class A shares as part of the Merger process. This move is proposed to streamline the share structure, ensuring simplicity and uniformity across all shares. Simplifying the share classification is part of the Company’s broader efforts to improve administrative efficiency as a private company.   Cancellation of Treasury Shares  In connection with the Merger, there is a resolution to cancel BenevolentAI’s existing treasury shares, which were originally issued and subsequently redeemed by the Company as part of the 2022 deSPAC process. These shares neither confer voting nor dividend rights, nor do they actively contribute to shareholder value. Their presence complicates the capital structure and generates unnecessary administrative overhead. Cancelling these shares as part of the Merger process is therefore aimed at simplifying BenevolentAI’s equity structure as the Company transitions to a private structure.   Treatment of warrants  The Company had previously issued a total of 16,600,000 warrants, comprised of 10,000,000 Class A warrants traded on Euronext Amsterdam and 6,600,000 Class B warrants, not listed on any exchange. Collectively, the Class A and Class B warrants are referred to as the “BenevolentAI Warrants”.   As part of the Merger process, Osaka Holdings will issue an equivalent number of warrants (the “Osaka Holdings Warrants”) to all current holders of BenevolentAI Warrants on 12 March 2025. This issuance ensures that each holder of BenevolentAI Warrants will receive one Osaka Holdings Warrant for each warrant they currently hold, facilitating a direct and proportionate transition of rights as part of the Merger process. ABN AMRO will continue to serve as the warrant agent for Osaka Holdings post-Merger.   The Osaka Holdings Warrants will be governed by the same warrant terms & conditions as originally established for the BenevolentAI Warrants (the “Warrant T&Cs), details of which are published on the Company’s website: https://www.benevolent.com/investors/. As per the Warrant T&Cs, warrant holders will be entitled to purchase one share in Osaka Holdings for an exercise price of €11.50.   Consistent with the original Warrant T&Cs, the exercise price will be adjusted for a 30-day period starting on the Merger Date, 12 March 2025, using a predefined formula. Detailed information about the adjusted exercise price and instructions for exercising the Osaka Holdings Warrants during this period will be included in the press release scheduled for 12 March 2025, which will announce the results of the EGM and the completion of the Merger.   Board Recommendation  The Board considers the Delisting to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and, accordingly, unanimously recommends shareholders to vote in favour of the Resolutions being proposed at the EGM. Directors who hold shares have committed to do so in respect of their beneficial holdings, in aggregate, including the Executive Chairman, who is the largest shareholder.   Kenneth Mulvany, Executive Chairman of BenevolentAI, commented:  ""After careful review and, in particular, consideration of the costs attributable to the Company maintaining its listing on Euronext, the Board has unanimously concluded that the proposed Delisting is in the best interests of BenevolentAI and its shareholders. The Board is firmly of the view that the Company must prioritise investment that accelerates its innovation cycle and enhances product development. The proposed Delisting is a crucial component of the Company’s capital allocation and fiscal efficiency.”   Extraordinary General Meeting  The EGM will be held on 12 March 2025 at 10 a.m. CET at 2, place Winston Churchill, L-1340 Luxembourg. At the EGM, shareholders shall vote on the following agenda items, which are together referred to as the “Resolutions”:     -      subject to the approval of the Merger, the conversion of all the 2,500,000 Class B shares without nominal value of the Company into 2,500,000 Class A shares so that the share capital of the Company is represented by only by Class A shares;       -      subject to the approval of the Merger, the reduction of the Company’s current issued share capital by cancelling all 20,686,419 Class A shares currently held in the Company’s treasury;       -      acknowledgement of the reports of the board of directors of the Company and the board of managers of Osaka Holdings, setting out the legal and economic grounds for the Merger and explaining the share exchange ratio and the warrants exchange ratio, and of the independent experts of the merging companies confirming that the share exchange ratio is fair and reasonable, and;       -      acknowledgment and approval of the Merger Proposal and decision to realise the merger of the Company, as absorbed company, and Osaka Holdings, as absorbing company, by way of merger by absorption.      To be passed, the Resolutions require the approval of at least two-thirds of the votes validly cast in favour by the shareholders present or represented provided that a quorum of 50% of the Company’s issued share capital is present or represented at the EGM.   Publication of Notice of Extraordinary General Meeting and related documents  The convening notice for the EGM, the proxy form and the documents related to the items on the EGM agenda (including the Merger Proposal) will be on display for inspection by the shareholders on the Company’s website https://www.benevolent.com/investors/ and at the registered office of the Company from or around 10 February 2025. Upon request to ABN AMRO (ava@nl.abnamro.com) or to the Company (investors@benevolent.ai), copies of the above- mentioned documents will be e-mailed to the shareholders.   The shareholders entitled to participate and vote at the EGM will be those who are shareholders on the record date of 26 February 2025 at 24:00 (midnight) CET.   The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the full text of the Appendix to this press release and the full Merger Proposal to be published on Monday, 10 February 2025 on https://www.benevolent.com/investors/. The Merger will be subject to the conditions and other terms set out in this Announcement and the Merger Proposal.

"CTP signs 64,000 sqm of new leases with leading Serbian logistics business",https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250205375551/en/CTP-signs-64000-sqm-of-new-leases-with-leading-Serbian-logistics-business,2025-02-06 06:30:00," AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:   CTP, Europe's largest listed developer, owner, and manager of industrial and logistics properties by gross lettable area (GLA), has signed three new leases with Milšped, a leading logistics provider for Serbia and Southeast Europe, totalling 64,000 sqm. This brings Milšped’s overall footprint with CTP to 105,000 sqm, representing a significant expansion in the company’s operations and helping it meet the increasing demand for logistics services across Serbia and the wider CEE region.   The three new deals strengthen an already successful partnership and make Milšped one of CTP’s largest clients in Serbia. The new leases span CTP industrial and logistics parks across the country, including at a newly developed CTPark in Niš, Serbia’s third largest city, while Milšped has also signed leases to take additional space at CTParks in Belgrade and Novi Sad.   At CTPark Belgrade West, Milšped signed a lease in December for the entire building SIM 6, from which it will be providing logistics services for a leading multinational client. Located in an established industrial zone near Šimanovci, with excellent transport links to the Beograd-Zagreb E-701 motorway and Nikola Tesla International Airport, the facility will boost Milšped's logistics capabilities, enabling the efficient management and expansion of its regional distribution network.   Earlier in June, Milšped further developed its cooperation with CTP by leasing space at the new CTPark Niš in central Serbia, from where it will serve major international clients across various industries. The logistics company is also expanding its existing space at CTPark Novi Sad East, to accommodate the growing needs of their client. The park is well located for business with direct international railway access and close proximity to the EU border. Milšped will take advantage of this to provide excellent logistics services to its international client base.   Milšped’s expansion highlights the rapid growth of the third-party logistics (3PL) sector in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), driven by factors such as nearshoring, regional manufacturing growth, and the rise of e-commerce. As demand for modern logistics infrastructure continues to grow, Milšped’s investment in flexible and state-of-the-art facilities with CTP ensures it is well-equipped to meet the evolving needs of an extensive modern client base.   Laza Kovačević, Managing Director for CTP Serbia, said: ""Our successful partnership with Milšped highlights how strategic location selection and scalable logistics solutions have allowed us to support the expansion of the business. This is enabling Milšped to meet the growing demands of its clients, and provide the flexibility needed to accommodate rapidly evolving business needs across the region. We pride ourselves on our close relationships with clients, which explains why 70% of all new deals we sign across our portfolio are with existing clients. Our relationship with Milšped means we understand their what they need from their space, and we can support them with everything from expanding capacity at their existing locations to developing properties suited to their needs in entirely new locations suitable for them. This mirrors what we do time and again for many of our clients.”   Nebojsa Krivokuca at Milšped commented: “Our collaboration with CTP has been integral to our expansion in the region. These new logistics facilities will provide us with the space and infrastructure needed to support our expanding multinational client base and meet their needs. We're excited about the opportunities these new facilities will offer as we continue to strengthen our footprint in Serbia.”   CTP is the leading developer of industrial and logistics properties in Serbia, managing a total gross leasable area (GLA) of 600,000 sqm with an additional 200,000 sqm to be delivered in 2025. Its parks are strategically located in key cities, including Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac, Jagodina, and Niš. CTP’s premier industrial parks, such as CTPark Belgrade North and CTPark Belgrade West, offer Class A facilities with excellent transportation links to major European cities and are conveniently located near Nikola Tesla International Airport. This presents significant investment opportunities in CTP’s Serbian locations, contributing to a more robust logistics and industrial sector.   ENDS  About CTP  CTP is Europe’s largest listed owner, developer, and manager of logistics and industrial real estate by gross lettable area, owning 12.6 million sqm of GLA across 10 countries as of 30 September 2024.
